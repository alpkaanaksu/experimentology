## A simple regression model: Treatment effect estimation in a two-group experiment

<!-- MM: Important: Estimation chapter actually foreshadows *Welch's* t-test because it describes unequal vars. Inference chapter generically refers to a t-test without making distinction. Discuss with MCF. -->

* Motivate the t-test as a regression model (nice segue from "Estimation")

While there are many types of statistical models, this chapter will focus primarily on regression, a broad and extremely powerful class of models. A regression model is a model that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent variables. In fact, many common statistical estimators (like the sample mean) and methods of inference (like the $t$-test) are actually very simple regression models. Understanding this point will help you to see many statistical methods as merely special cases of the same regression framework, rather than as unrelated, ad hoc methods. 

Let's start with one of these special cases, namely estimating a treatment effect, $\Delta$, in a two-group design. In Chapter \@ref(estimation), we did so for the tea-tasting experiment by positing a model in which the milk-first ratings were normally distributed with mean $\theta_{milkfirst} = \theta_{teafirst} + \Delta$ and with standard deviation $\sigma_{milkfirst}$. Let's now write that model more formally in terms of what it implies about each participant's tea rating, $Y_i$, given that person's treatment assignment, $X_i$, where $X_i=0$ represents the control (milk-first) group and $X_i=1$ represents the treatment (tea-first) group.

<!-- MM: Not sure if align environment is supported in RMD. Might need to use this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47912278/align-environment-in-r-markdown-which-works-for-both-docx-and-pdf-output --> 
\begin{align*}
Y_i &= \theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta X_i + \epsilon_i \\
\epsilon_i &\sim N(0, \sigma^2)
\end{align*}

In the first line, $\theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta X_i$ is called the **linear predictor**, and it describes the expected value of an individual's tea rating, $Y_i$, given that person's treatment group $X_i$. That is, for a participant in the control group, the linear predictor is just equal to $\theta_{milkfirst}$, which is indeed the mean for the control group. On the other hand, for a participant in the treatment group, the linear predictor is equal to $\theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta$, which is indeed the mean for the treatment group. The terms $\epsilon_i$ are **error terms**, referring to random variation of participants' ratings around their group mean. Note that this is a very specific kind of "error"; it not to "error" due to bias, for example. Instead, you can think of the error terms as capturing the "error" that would be associated with predicting any given participant's rating based on just the linear predictor. If you thus predicted a control group participant's rating as $\theta_{milkfirst}$, this would be a good guess, but you still expect the participant's rating to deviate somewhat from $\theta_{milkfirst}$ due to "error". In this model, the linear predictor and error terms together say that participants' ratings scatter randomly (actually, normally) around their group means with standard deviation $\sigma$. And that is exactly the model we posited earlier. 


## Regression more generally

* Describe basic anatomy of a GLM; remember to explain intercept as just another covariate
* Describe the assumptions and amazing properties of OLS (e.g., BLUE, MLE, etc.)
* Probably too much, but would be super cool to briefly show the beautiful geometry behind OLS? Maybe make a sidebar


## Generalizing the linear predictor: Adding covariates

* Show how the linear predictor can be generalized to add covariates
* Include material below that's already written about whether and when to do this


## Generalizing the link function: Accommodating other outcome types


## Generalizing the linear predictor: Accommodating clustering

* Focus on random intercepts
* Also mention GEE as an alternative approach that doesn't change the linear predictor


## Connection to Bayesian approaches

* Say that what we have covered so far is essentially just the likelihood; formalize the intuition from "Estimation" about Bayesian inference to show how a prior affects the model specification




## Inference and estimation for two-group designs

Throughout this book we've taken the position that the goal of experiments is to estimate a causal effect of interest, ideally as part of some theory of how different constructs relate to one another. All this talk of hypotheses and inferences above is only indirectly related to that goal. 





- Intuition builder: For very large n, or flat prior, Bayes and frequentist coincide. 


### Simple models of between-group differences

Introducing simple inference models:

- The chi-squared test for inferring whether two samples come from the same distribution
- The t-test for inferring whether a single group‚Äôs effect differs from 0
- The t-test for inferring whether two groups differ from one another
- The paired t-test as a first glimpse at how we might account for participant-level random effects (see Chapter 7).

::: {.accident-report}
‚ö†Ô∏è Accident report: Mediation going wrong: even when you have a randomized experiment, you can still mess up your causal inference (Montgomery, Nyhan, and Torres 2018). 
:::

- Dropping subjects who fail a manipulation check can be problematic (Aronow, Baron, and Pinson 2019).
- Mediation requires more confounding assumptions than causal inference about total effects, and these assumptions may be violated even in randomized experiments. 


Estimating one quantity in isolation is often not the best thing to do. In almost any experiment, there will be variation in the estimate that has to do with other known sources. Imagine the Stroop effect, which has a fairly consistent effect on both fast and slow readers [@haaf2017]. But estimates of this effect will be more precise if we take into account that some readers are slower or faster, rather than just averaging across all this variation. That's why we need models that take into account different sources of variation. 

## Covariates

- adjusting models for unhappy randomization?

Going back to our example, now we have two variables ‚Äì age and order ‚Äì that are no longer confounded with our primary relationship of interest (i.e., Dylan and writing). But they may still be related to our outcome measure. Here's what the picture looks like, repeated from above.



Even if they are not confounding our experimental manipulation, age and experimental condition order may still be correlated with our outcome measure, writing skill. How does this work? Well, the average treatment effect of Dylan on writing is still given by the regression Y ~ X.  But we also know that there is some variance in Y that is due to X' and Z.

That's because age and order are covariates: they may ‚Äì by virtue of their potential causal links with the outcome variable ‚Äì have some correlation with outcomes, even in a case where the predictor is experimentally manipulated. This should be intuitive for the external (age) covariate, but it's true for both: they may account for variance in Y over and above that controlled by the experimental manipulation of X.

What should we do about our covariates?

Option 1. Nothing! We are totally safe in ignoring all of our covariates, regressing Y on X and treating the estimate as an unbiased estimate of the the effect (the ATE). This is why randomization is awesome. We are guaranteed that, in the limit of many different experiments, even though people with different ages will be in the different Dylan conditions, this source of variation will be averaged out.

The first fallacy of covariates is that, because you have a known covariate, you have to adjust for it. Not true. You can just ignore it and your estimate of the ATE is unbiased. This is the norm in cognitive psychology, for example: variation between individuals is treated as noise and averaged out. Of course, there are weaknesses in this strategy ‚Äì you will not learn about the relationship of your treatment to those covariates! ‚Äì but it is sound.

Option 2. If you have a small handful of covariates that you believe are meaningfully related to the outcome, you can plan in advance to adjust for them in your regression. In our Dylan example, this would be a pre-registered plan to add Z as a predictor: Y ~ X + Z. If age (Z) is highly correlated with writing ability (Y), then this will give us a more precise estimate of the ATE, while remaining unbiased.

When should we do this? Well, it turns out that you need a pretty strong correlation to make a big difference. There's some nice code to simulate the effects of covariate adjustment on precision in this useful blogpost on covariate adjustment; I lightly adapted it. Here's the result:



Root mean squared error (RMSE; lower RMSE means greater precision, in other words) is plotted as a function of the sample size (N). Different colors show the increase in precision when you control for covariates with different levels of correlation with the outcome variable. For low levels of correlation with the covariate, you don't get much increase in precision (pink and red lines). Only as the correlation is .6 or above do we see noticeable increases in precision; and it only really makes a big difference with correlations in the range of .8.

Considering these numbers in light of our Dylan study, I would bet that age and writing skill are not correlated with writing skill > .8 (unless we're looking at ages from kindergarten to college!). I would guess that in an adult population this correlation would be much, much lower. So maybe it's not worth controlling for age in our analyses.

And the same is probably true for order, our other covariate. Although perhaps we do think that our order has a strong correlation with our skill measure. For example, maybe our experiment is long and  there are big fatigue effects. In that case, we would want to condition.

So these are are options: if the covariate is known to be very strong, we can condition. Otherwise we should probably not worry about it.

What shouldn't we do with our covariates?

Don't condition on lots and lots of covariates because you think they are theoretically important. There are lots of things that people do with covariates that they shouldn't be doing. My personal hunch is that this is because a lot of researchers think that covariates (especially demographic ones like age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, etc.) are important. That's true: these are important variables. But that doesn't mean you need to control for them in every regression. This leads us to the second fallacy.

The second fallacy of covariates is that, because you think covariates are in general meaningful, it is not harmful to control for them in your regression model. In fact, if you control for meaningless covariates in a standard regression model, you will on average reduce your ability to see differences in your treatment effect. Just by chance your noise covariates will "soak up" variation in the response, leaving less to be accounted for by the true treatment effect! Even if you strongly suspect something is a covariate, you should be careful before throwing it into your regression model.

Don't condition on covariates because your groups are unbalanced. People often talk about "unhappy randomization": you randomize adults to the different Dylan groups, for example, but then it turns out the mean age is a bit different between groups. Then you do a t-test or some other statistical test and find out that you actually have a significant age difference. But this makes no sense: because you randomized, you know that the difference in ages occurred by chance, so why are you using a t-test to test if the variation is due to chance? In addition, if your covariate isn't highly correlated with the outcome, this difference won't matter (see above). Finally, if you adjust for this covariate because of such a statistical test, you can actually end up biasing estimates of the ATE across the literature. Here's a really useful blogpost from the Worldbank that has more details on why you shouldn't follow this practice.

Don't condition on covariates post-hoc. The previous example is a special case of a general practice that you shouldn't follow. Don't look at your data and then decide to control for covariates! Conditioning on covariates based on your data is an extremely common route for p-hacking; in fact, it's so common that it shows up in Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn's (2011) instant classic False Positive Psychology paper as one of the key ingredients of analytic flexibility. Data-dependent selection of covariates is a quick route to false positive findings that will be less likely to be replicable in independent samples.

Don't condition on a post-treatment variable. As we discussed above, there are some reasons to condition on highly-correlated covariates in general. But there's an exception to this rule. There are some variables that are never OK to condition on ‚Äì in particular, any variable that is collected after treatment. For example, we might think that another good covariate would be someone's enjoyment of Bob Dylan. So, after the writing measurements are done, we do a Dylan Appreciation Questionnaire (DAQ). The problem is, imagine that having a bad experience writing while listening to Dylan might actually change your DAQ score. So then people in the Dylan condition would have lower DAQ on average. If we control for DAQ in our regression (Y ~ X + DAQ), we then distort our estimate of the effects of Dylan. Because DAQ and X (Dylan condition) are correlated, DAQ will end up soaking up some variance that is actually due to condition. This is bad news. Here's a nice paper that explains this issue in more detail.

Don't condition on a collider. This issue is a little bit off-topic for the current post, since it's primarily an issue in observational designs, but here's a really good blogpost about it.

Conclusions

Covariates and confounds are some of the most basic concepts underlying experimental design and analysis in psychology, yet they are surprisingly complicated to explain. Often the issues seem clear until it comes time to do the data analysis, at which point different assumptions lead to different default analytic strategies. I'm especially concerned that these strategies vary by culture, for example with some psychologists always conditioning on confounders, and others never doing so. (We haven't even talked about mediation and moderation!). Hopefully this post has been useful in using the vocabulary of causal models to explain some of these issues.

* The definitive resource on causal graphical models is Pearl (2009). It's not easy going, but it's very important stuff. Even just starting to read it will strengthen your methods/stats muscles.
** Importantly, it's a lot like adding random effects to your model ‚Äì you model sources of structure in your data so that you can better estimate the particular effects of interest.
*** The advice not to model covariates that aren't very correlated with your outcome is very frequentist, with the idea being that you lose power when you condition on too many things. In contrast, Gelman & Hill (2006) give more Bayesian advice: if you think a variable matters to your outcome, keep it in the model. This advice is consistent with the idea of modeling experimental covariates, even if they don't have a big correlation with the outcome. In the Bayesian framework, including this extra information should (maybe only marginally) improve your precision but you aren't "spending degrees of freedom" in the same way.
