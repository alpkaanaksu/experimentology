## A simple regression model: Treatment effect estimation in a two-group experiment

<!-- MBM to MCF: Estimation chapter actually foreshadows *Welch's* t-test because it describes unequal vars. Inference chapter generically refers to a t-test without making distinction. Let's discuss. -->


There are many types of statistical models, but this chapter will focus primarily on regression, a broad and extremely powerful class of models. A regression model relates a dependent variable to one or more independent variables. Dependent variables are sometimes called "outcome variables", and independent variables are sometimes called "predictor variables", "covariates", or "features". We will see that many common statistical estimators (like the sample mean) and methods of inference (like the $t$-test) are actually simple regression models. Understanding this point will help you see many statistical methods as special cases of the same underlying framework, rather than as unrelated, ad hoc methods. 

Let's start with one of these special cases, namely estimating a treatment effect, $\Delta$, in a two-group design. In Chapter \@ref(estimation), we did so for the tea-tasting experiment by positing a model in which the milk-first ratings were normally distributed with mean $\theta_{milkfirst} = \theta_{teafirst} + \Delta$ and with standard deviation $\sigma_{milkfirst}$. Let's now write that model more formally as a regression model, that is, a model relating each participant's tea rating, $Y_i$, given that participant's treatment assignment, $X_i$, where $X_i=0$ represents the control (milk-first) group and $X_i=1$ represents the treatment (tea-first) group. Here, $Y_i$ is the dependent variable, and $X_i$ is the independent variable.

<!-- MBM to MCF: Let's discuss whether to switch to standard notation (e.g., betas) in this chapter or to stick with notation more like the previous chapter. I might lean toward using standard notation here and syncing earlier chapter with that notation. -->
<!-- MM: Not sure if align environment is supported in RMD. Might need to use this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47912278/align-environment-in-r-markdown-which-works-for-both-docx-and-pdf-output --> 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ols_ttest}
Y_i &= \theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta X_i + \epsilon_i \\
\epsilon_i &\sim N(0, \sigma^2)
\end{align}

(In the second line, the tilde means "is distributed as", and what follows is a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$.)

A model like this is called a **linear regression of Y on X**. In the first line, $\theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta X_i$ is called the **linear predictor**, and it describes the expected value of an individual's tea rating, $Y_i$, given that participant's treatment group $X_i$ (the single independent variable in this model). That is, for a participant in the control group ($X_i=0$), the linear predictor is just equal to $\theta_{milkfirst}$, which is indeed the mean for the control group that we specified above. On the other hand, for a participant in the treatment group, the linear predictor is equal to $\theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta$, which is indeed the mean for the treatment group that we specified. In regression jargon, $\Delta$ is a **regression coefficient**, representing the association of the independent variable $X_i$ with the outcome $Y_i$.

In the second line of Equation \ref{eq:ols_ttest}, the terms $\epsilon_i$ are **error terms**, referring to random variation of participants' ratings around their group mean. Note that this is a very specific kind of "error"; it not to "error" due to bias, for example. Instead, you can think of the error terms as capturing the "error" that would be associated with predicting any given participant's rating based on just the linear predictor. If you thus predicted a control group participant's rating as $\theta_{milkfirst}$, this would be a good guess, but you still expect the participant's rating to deviate somewhat from $\theta_{milkfirst}$ due to "error". In this model, the linear predictor and error terms together say that participants' ratings scatter randomly (in fact, normally) around their group means with standard deviation $\sigma$. And that is exactly the model we posited earlier. [NOT TRUE BECAUSE PREVIOUS MODEL USED UNEQUAL VARIANCES.] 

Having posited this model, we would then want to estimate the regression coefficients $\theta_{milkfirst}$ and $\Delta$. The usual method to do so is called **ordinary least squares (OLS)**. Here is the basic idea. For any given regression coefficient estimates $\widehat{\theta}_{milkfirst}$ and $\widehat{\Delta}$, we would obtain different **predicted values**, $\widehat{Y}_i = \theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta X_i$ for each participant. Some regression coefficient estimates will yield better predictions than others. **OLS estimation is designed to find the values of the regression coefficients that optimize these predictions, meaning that the predictions are as close as possible to participants' true outcomes, $Y_i$.**[^models-1] 


[^models-1]: Specifically, OLS minimizes squared error loss, in the sense that it will choose the regression coefficient estimates whose predictions minimize $\sum_{i=1}^n \left( Y_i - \widehat{Y}_i\right)^2$, where $n$ is the sample size. A wonderful thing about OLS is that those optimal regression coefficients (generically termed $\widehat{\mathbf{\beta}}$) turn out to have a very simple closed form: $\widehat{\mathbf{\beta}} = \left( \mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X} \right)^{-1} \mathbf{X}'\mathbf{y}$. We are using more general notation here because there could be multiple independent variables. Therefore, $\widehat{\mathbf{\beta}}$ is a vector, $\mathbf{X}$ is a matrix of independent variables for each subject, and $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector of participants' outcomes. As more good news, the standard error for $\widehat{\mathbf{\beta}}$ has a similarly simple closed form. 


## Generalizing the linear predictor: Adding covariates


It turns out that much more complex estimation problems than this can also be written as regression models, essentially by extending what we did for the simple tea-tasting experiment in Equation (\ref{eq:ols_ttest}). For example, we might want to add another independent variable, such as age. [USE EXISTING DYLAN EXAMPLE BELOW?] We could then add this new independent variable and a corresponding regression coefficient to the model:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:ols_one_covariate}
Y_i &= \theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta X_{i1} + \theta_{age} X_{i2}  + \epsilon_i \\
\epsilon_i &\sim N(0, \sigma^2)
\end{align}

Now that we have multiple independent variables, we've labeled them $X_{i1}$ (treatment group) and $X_{i2}$ (age in years) for clarity.

To illustrate how to interpret the regression coefficients in this model, let's use the linear predictor to compare the model's predicted tea ratings for two hypothetical participants who are both in the treatment group: 20-year-old Alice and 21-year old Bob. Alice's linear predictor tells us that her expected rating is $\theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta + \theta_{age} \cdot 20$. In contrast, Bob's linear predictor is $\theta_{milkfirst} + \Delta + \theta_{age} \cdot 21$. We could therefore calculate the expected difference in ratings for 21-year-olds versus 20-year olds by subtracting Alice's linear predictor from Bob's, yielding just $\theta_{age}$. How simple! In fact, we would get the same result if Alice and Bob were instead 50 and 51 years old, respectively. Try this yourself. This equivalence illustrates a key point about linear regression models in general: **the regression coefficient represents the mean (i.e., expected) difference in $Y_i$ when comparing participants who differ by 1 unit of the corresponding independent variable** (here, comparing participants who differ by 1 year of age). In "Practical modeling considerations" below, we discuss whether and when to control for additional independent variables.

## When does linear regression work?


The models shown above (Equations \ref{eq:ols_ttest} and \ref{eq:ols_one_covariate}) are a special type of linear regression model. These models are linear in the sense that they assume that expected outcomes scale linearly as any given independent variable increases or decreases (e.g., a 1-unit increase in age is associated with a constant change, $\theta_{age}$, in the expected outcome). OLS also assumes, critically, that the error terms ($\epsilon_i$) have the same normal distribution (i.e., mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$) for *any* fixed values of the independent variables. This implies that the errors are equally variable for any fixed values of the independent variables, which is called **homoskedasticity**.

OLS is incredibly powerful. In fact, if the assumptions above are fulfilled, OLS is the best linear model we can possibly use.[^models-2] However, it's important to be aware of situations where its assumptions might be violated. Let's look at each assumption in more detail, along with situations in which the assumptions may be violated:

[COULD MAYBE TURN SOME OF THIS INTO A TABLE?]

1. **The linear predictor must be correctly specified.** Notice that in our comparison of Alice's and Bob's expected outcomes based on their 1-year age difference, we were able to interpret the coefficient $\theta_{age}$ as the average difference in $Y_i$ when comparing participants who differ by 1 year of age, *regardless* of whether those ages are 20 vs. 21, 50 vs. 51, etc. This is because the way the linear predictor is specified in Equation \ref{eq:ols_one_covariate} embeds the assumption that age is *linearly* related to expected outcomes. For many scientific contexts, this assumption is reasonable, but in other contexts, it may be badly violated. For example, if we sampled participants whose ages ranged from 1 to 60 years and plotted their ages versus their vocabulary sizes, we would probably find that there is a much bigger difference in vocabulary between typical 1-year-olds vs. typical 2-year olds than between typical 50-year-olds vs. typical 51-year olds. One way to accommodate such **nonlinearities** is to modify the linear predictor to include polynomial terms, such as $age^2$, which then allow us to fit a curve rather than just a straight line. It is always a good idea to use visualizations like scatterplots to look for possible problems with the specification of the linear predictor. It can be a helpful visual aid to superimpose on these plots a model-free (i.e., "nonparametric") estimate of the relationship, such as a LOESS curve. 

[Suggested Figure. Panel A: Scatterplot showing a nice linear relationship with OLS fit superimposed. Panel B: Scatterplot showing a nonlinear relationship with OLS fit, OLS fit with x^2 term, and LOESS superimposed.]


2. **The errors must be independent.** This will hold if observations in the regression model (i.e., rows in the dataset) are sampled independently, for example if participants were independently recruited for a study, and each performed a single trial. On the other hand, suppose we have repeated-measures data in which we sample participants, and then obtain multiple outcome measurements over time for each participant. Usually, outcome measurements within a participant will be correlated: if we measure 10 participants' blood pressures every day for a week, some participants will typically have high values whereas others will typically have low values, even though any given participant will also have some variation in their own measurements over time.[^models-3] To help identify such situations, it can be helpful to plot the distribution of **residuals** for each participant (or a random sample thereof) to see whether this distribution seems to differ across participants. [YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN EARLIER WHAT RESIDUALS ARE]

[Suggested Figure. Violin plots, or similar, showing residuals for different subjects. The residuals exhibit non-independence.]

3. **The errors must be normal and homoskedastic.** In contrast, this could be violated if error terms are more variable for some values of the independent variables than for other values (the errors are **heteroskedastic**). This is often the case for highly skewed outcome variables. For example, if we regressed participants' incomes on their years of education, we will find that higher education is associated with higher income. However, because income is highly right-skewed in many samples (some people have extremely high incomes), income will typically be more variable for individuals with more education than for those with less education. For this reason, if we predicted incomes for individuals with 16 years of education (i.e., they completed 4-year college and then stopped) and also for individuals with 8 years (i.e., they completed middle school and then stopped), the errors in the former predictions will probably be more variable than the errors in the latter predictions. It is a good idea to plot each independent variable versus the residuals to see if the residuals are more variable for certain values of the independent variable than for others.

[Suggested Figure. X vs. residuals, showing heteroskedasticity.]


[^models-2]: There is a precise sense in which OLS gives the *very best* predictions we could ever get from any model that posits linear relationships between the independent variables and the outcome. That is, you can come up with any other linear model you want, and yet if the assumptions of OLS are fulfilled, predictions from OLS will always be less noisy than those of your model. This is because of an elegant mathematical result called the Gauss-Markov Theorem. (MBM to MCF: Feel free to delete.)

[^models-3] To be specific, it is not the blood pressure values ($Y_i$) themselves that must be independent, but rather the error terms ($\epsilon$). The error terms are what is "left over" after accounting for systematic variation that is predicted by the independent variables. If, in principle, we managed to include in the linear predictor all variables that might explain individual differences in typical blood pressure (e.g., genetic factors, sex, age, etc.), then the errors would be independent even though the outcomes themselves are not. However, as a heuristic, considering possible sources of correlation in the outcomes themselves is often a reasonable proxy for thinking about the error terms.


## Generalizing the link function: Accommodating non-continuous outcomes

So far we have considered continuous outcome measures, like tea ratings. What if we instead had a binary outcome, such as whether a participant liked or didn't like the tea, or a count outcome, such as the number of cups a participant chose to drink? These and other non-continuous outcomes often violate the assumptions of OLS, in particular because they often induce heteroskedastic errors. For example, count outcomes are often right-skewed because a count cannot be less than 0, creating heteroskedasticity for the same reasons discussed above when we considered skewed continuous outcomes. Binary outcomes inherently violate heteroskedasticity because the variance of a binary variable depends directly on the success probability; this means that the errors will be more variable for individuals whose covariate values place their expected success probability closer to 0.50.[^models-4] 

Happily, there are regression models closely related to OLS that can handle non-continuous outcomes. These models are called **generalized linear models** (GLM), and OLS is one of many members of this large class of models. To see the connection, let's first write an OLS model more generally in terms of what it says about the expected value of the outcome:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:ols_general_form}
E[Y_i] &= \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j X_j
\end{align}
where $p$ is the number of independent variables, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, and $\beta_j$ is the regression coefficient for the $j^{th}$ independent variable.

The linear predictor of a GLM (i.e., $\beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j X_j$) looks exactly the same as for OLS, but instead of modeling $E[Y_i]$, a GLM models some **transformation**, $g(.)$, of the expectation:[^models-5] 

\begin{align}
\label{eq:glm_general_form}
g( E[Y_i] ) &= \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j X_j 
\end{align}

It turns out that by choosing a transformation of $E[Y_i]$ that is suitable for the outcome type, we can still fit a linear model. This transformation is called the **link function**. For example, $g(x) = log(x)$ is usually a suitable link function for count or binary outcomes. GLMs also handle the error terms differently from OLS, but we won't cover that here. We have only scratched the surface of GLMs here, but the take-home point is simply that they are usually the tool of choice for fitting regression models with non-continuous outcomes. 


[^models-4] Specifically, the variance of a binary variable with success probability $p$ is simply $p(1-p)$, which is maximized at $p=0.50$. 

[^models-5] Note that GLMs involve transforming the *expectation* of the outcome, not the outcome itself! That is, we are not just taking the outcome variable in our dataset and transforming it before fitting an OLS model, but rather we are fitting a different model entirely, one that posits a fundamentally different relationship between the predictors and the expected outcomes.



## Generalizing the linear predictor: Accommodating clustering

As noted above, another common situation in which the assumptions of OLS are violated is when the error terms are not independent, for example in repeated-measures data in which participants' error terms across time points are likely to be clustered. We will discuss two classes of methods for accommodating clustering in regression. 

The first class of methods is **linear mixed models** (LMM). In this approach, we modify the linear predictor itself to model differences across clusters. Suppose we modified the original tea-tasting experiment (without the age covariate) to collect repeated ratings from each participant, such that each participant tastes 5 milk-first and 5 tea-first cups. Then we could fit a LMM as follows:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:lmm}
Y_i &= \theta_{milkfirst} + \gamma_i + \Delta X_{it} + \epsilon_{it} \\
\gamma_i \sim N(0, \tau^2) \\
\epsilon_{it} &\sim N(0, \sigma^2) \\
\end{align}

where $Y_{it}$ is participant $i$'s rating in trial $t$ and $X_{it}$ is the participant's assigned treatment in trial $t$ (i.e., milk-first or tea-first). Compare this model to the basic OLS model in Equation (\ref{eq:ols_ttest}). Here we've introduced another intercept coefficient, $\gamma_i$, and it's unlike the original intercept $\theta_{milkfirst}$ in that $\gamma_i$ varies across participants. As such, $\gamma_i$ is a **random intercept**, whereas $\theta_{milkfirst}$ is a **fixed intercept**. Specifically, we have assumed that each participant has their own typical "baseline" tea rating -- some participants generally like tea more than others -- and that these baseline ratings are normally distributed across participants. Thus, ratings are correlated within participants because ratings cluster around each participant's *unique* baseline tea rating. LMMs can be further extended to model clustering of the independent variables' effects across subjects. To do so, we could introduce **random slopes** ($\gamma_i$) to the model, which represent differences across participants in the effects of independent variables:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:lmm}
Y_i &= \theta_{milkfirst} + \gamma_i + \Delta X_{it} + \gamma_j + X_{i1} + \epsilon_{it} \\
\gamma_i \sim N(0, \tau^2) \\
\epsilon_i &\sim N(0, \sigma^2) \\
\end{align}

LMM is powerful and is a very common approach in psychology, but it does have limitations. Its validity relies on our ability to correctly specify the structure of the random intercepts and errors. This is particularly problematic when the correlation structure of the errors is misspecified, for example if observations within a participant are more correlated for participants in the treatment group than in the control group; in such cases, LMM estimates can be substantially biased [@bie]. It can be difficult to verify if the model specification is reasonable, especially with a small number of clusters or observations. Even if the model is correctly specified, LMM can severely underestimate standard errors (e.g., yielding too-small $p$-values) if the number of clusters is not large.[^models-6]


A second class of methods that helps resolve these issues is **generalized estimating equations** (GEE). In this approach, we leave the linear predictor alone. We do not add random intercepts or slopes, nor do we assume anything about the distribution of the errors (i.e., we no longer assume that they are normal, independent, and homoskedastic). We instead provide the model with an initial "guess" about how we think the errors might be related to one another; for example, in a repeated-measures experiment, we might guess that the errors are exchangeable, meaning that they are correlated to the same degree within each participant but are uncorrelated across participants. Instead of *assuming* that our guess is correct, as does LMM, GEE estimates the correlation structure of the errors empirically, using our guess as a starting point, and it uses this correlation structure to arrive at point estimates and inference for the regression coefficients. Remarkably, as the number of clusters and observations become very large, GEE will *always* provide unbiased point estimates and valid inference, *even if* our guess about the correlation structure was bad. Additionally, with simple finite-sample corrections [@mancl2001covariance], GEE seems to provide valid inference at smaller numbers of clusters than does LMM. The price paid for these nice safeguards against model misspecification is that, in principle, GEE will typically have less statistical power than LMM *if* the LMM is in fact correctly specified, but the difference may be surprisingly slight in practice [@bie2021fitting]. For these reasons, we tend to prefer GEE with finite-sample corrections over LMM as the default model for clustered data. In general, we tend to favor LMM over GEE only when the number of observations and clusters are quite large, and when careful diagnostics also indicate that distributional assumptions are fulfilled.

[MBM to MCF: Above is what I usually say as my default recommendation for GEE vs. LMM, but happy to discuss and modify if you don't agree. I also haven't touched the marginal vs. conditional interpretation issue since this has been about LMM and not GLMM.]

[^models-6] How many clusters are enough for LMM to behave well? This is an active area of research, and the answer will depend on the number of observations in each cluster and the model structure. However, some empirical findings suggest that, at least for certain models, LMM can considerably underestimate standard errors even with, for example, 20 clusters each with 100 observations [@bie2021fitting].
 



## Connection to Bayesian approaches

* Say that what we have covered so far is essentially just the likelihood; formalize the intuition from "Estimation" about Bayesian inference to show how a prior affects the model specification



## Practical modeling considerations

### When does it makes sense to include covariates in a model?

- adjusting models for unhappy randomization?

Going back to our example, now we have two variables ‚Äì age and order ‚Äì that are no longer confounded with our primary relationship of interest (i.e., Dylan and writing). But they may still be related to our outcome measure. Here's what the picture looks like, repeated from above.


Even if they are not confounding our experimental manipulation, age and experimental condition order may still be correlated with our outcome measure, writing skill. How does this work? Well, the average treatment effect of Dylan on writing is still given by the regression Y ~ X.  But we also know that there is some variance in Y that is due to X' and Z.

That's because age and order are covariates: they may ‚Äì by virtue of their potential causal links with the outcome variable ‚Äì have some correlation with outcomes, even in a case where the predictor is experimentally manipulated. This should be intuitive for the external (age) covariate, but it's true for both: they may account for variance in Y over and above that controlled by the experimental manipulation of X.

What should we do about our covariates?

Option 1. Nothing! We are totally safe in ignoring all of our covariates, regressing Y on X and treating the estimate as an unbiased estimate of the the effect (the ATE). This is why randomization is awesome. We are guaranteed that, in the limit of many different experiments, even though people with different ages will be in the different Dylan conditions, this source of variation will be averaged out.

The first fallacy of covariates is that, because you have a known covariate, you have to adjust for it. Not true. You can just ignore it and your estimate of the ATE is unbiased. This is the norm in cognitive psychology, for example: variation between individuals is treated as noise and averaged out. Of course, there are weaknesses in this strategy ‚Äì you will not learn about the relationship of your treatment to those covariates! ‚Äì but it is sound.

Option 2. If you have a small handful of covariates that you believe are meaningfully related to the outcome, you can plan in advance to adjust for them in your regression. In our Dylan example, this would be a pre-registered plan to add Z as a predictor: Y ~ X + Z. If age (Z) is highly correlated with writing ability (Y), then this will give us a more precise estimate of the ATE, while remaining unbiased.

When should we do this? Well, it turns out that you need a pretty strong correlation to make a big difference. There's some nice code to simulate the effects of covariate adjustment on precision in this useful blogpost on covariate adjustment; I lightly adapted it. Here's the result:



Root mean squared error (RMSE; lower RMSE means greater precision, in other words) is plotted as a function of the sample size (N). Different colors show the increase in precision when you control for covariates with different levels of correlation with the outcome variable. For low levels of correlation with the covariate, you don't get much increase in precision (pink and red lines). Only as the correlation is .6 or above do we see noticeable increases in precision; and it only really makes a big difference with correlations in the range of .8.

Considering these numbers in light of our Dylan study, I would bet that age and writing skill are not correlated with writing skill > .8 (unless we're looking at ages from kindergarten to college!). I would guess that in an adult population this correlation would be much, much lower. So maybe it's not worth controlling for age in our analyses.

And the same is probably true for order, our other covariate. Although perhaps we do think that our order has a strong correlation with our skill measure. For example, maybe our experiment is long and  there are big fatigue effects. In that case, we would want to condition.

So these are are options: if the covariate is known to be very strong, we can condition. Otherwise we should probably not worry about it.

What shouldn't we do with our covariates?

Don't condition on lots and lots of covariates because you think they are theoretically important. There are lots of things that people do with covariates that they shouldn't be doing. My participantal hunch is that this is because a lot of researchers think that covariates (especially demographic ones like age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, etc.) are important. That's true: these are important variables. But that doesn't mean you need to control for them in every regression. This leads us to the second fallacy.

The second fallacy of covariates is that, because you think covariates are in general meaningful, it is not harmful to control for them in your regression model. In fact, if you control for meaningless covariates in a standard regression model, you will on average reduce your ability to see differences in your treatment effect. Just by chance your noise covariates will "soak up" variation in the response, leaving less to be accounted for by the true treatment effect! Even if you strongly suspect something is a covariate, you should be careful before throwing it into your regression model.

Don't condition on covariates because your groups are unbalanced. People often talk about "unhappy randomization": you randomize adults to the different Dylan groups, for example, but then it turns out the mean age is a bit different between groups. Then you do a t-test or some other statistical test and find out that you actually have a significant age difference. But this makes no sense: because you randomized, you know that the difference in ages occurred by chance, so why are you using a t-test to test if the variation is due to chance? In addition, if your covariate isn't highly correlated with the outcome, this difference won't matter (see above). Finally, if you adjust for this covariate because of such a statistical test, you can actually end up biasing estimates of the ATE across the literature. Here's a really useful blogpost from the Worldbank that has more details on why you shouldn't follow this practice.

Don't condition on covariates post-hoc. The previous example is a special case of a general practice that you shouldn't follow. Don't look at your data and then decide to control for covariates! Conditioning on covariates based on your data is an extremely common route for p-hacking; in fact, it's so common that it shows up in Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn's (2011) instant classic False Positive Psychology paper as one of the key ingredients of analytic flexibility. Data-dependent selection of covariates is a quick route to false positive findings that will be less likely to be replicable in independent samples.

Don't condition on a post-treatment variable. As we discussed above, there are some reasons to condition on highly-correlated covariates in general. But there's an exception to this rule. There are some variables that are never OK to condition on ‚Äì in particular, any variable that is collected after treatment. For example, we might think that another good covariate would be someone's enjoyment of Bob Dylan. So, after the writing measurements are done, we do a Dylan Appreciation Questionnaire (DAQ). The problem is, imagine that having a bad experience writing while listening to Dylan might actually change your DAQ score. So then people in the Dylan condition would have lower DAQ on average. If we control for DAQ in our regression (Y ~ X + DAQ), we then distort our estimate of the effects of Dylan. Because DAQ and X (Dylan condition) are correlated, DAQ will end up soaking up some variance that is actually due to condition. This is bad news. Here's a nice paper that explains this issue in more detail.

Don't condition on a collider. This issue is a little bit off-topic for the current post, since it's primarily an issue in observational designs, but here's a really good blogpost about it.

Conclusions

Covariates and confounds are some of the most basic concepts underlying experimental design and analysis in psychology, yet they are surprisingly complicated to explain. Often the issues seem clear until it comes time to do the data analysis, at which point different assumptions lead to different default analytic strategies. I'm especially concerned that these strategies vary by culture, for example with some psychologists always conditioning on confounders, and others never doing so. (We haven't even talked about mediation and moderation!). Hopefully this post has been useful in using the vocabulary of causal models to explain some of these issues.

---
* The definitive resource on causal graphical models is Pearl (2009). It's not easy going, but it's very important stuff. Even just starting to read it will strengthen your methods/stats muscles.
** Importantly, it's a lot like adding random effects to your model ‚Äì you model sources of structure in your data so that you can better estimate the particular effects of interest.
*** The advice not to model covariates that aren't very correlated with your outcome is very frequentist, with the idea being that you lose power when you condition on too many things. In contrast, Gelman & Hill (2006) give more Bayesian advice: if you think a variable matters to your outcome, keep it in the model. This advice is consistent with the idea of modeling experimental covariates, even if they don't have a big correlation with the outcome. In the Bayesian framework, including this extra information should (maybe only marginally) improve your precision but you aren't "spending degrees of freedom" in the same way.





## FROM PREVIOUS STRUCTURE: Inference and estimation for two-group designs

Throughout this book we've taken the position that the goal of experiments is to estimate a causal effect of interest, ideally as part of some theory of how different constructs relate to one another. All this talk of hypotheses and inferences above is only indirectly related to that goal. 





- Intuition builder: For very large n, or flat prior, Bayes and frequentist coincide. 


### Simple models of between-group differences

Introducing simple inference models:

- The chi-squared test for inferring whether two samples come from the same distribution
- The t-test for inferring whether a single group‚Äôs effect differs from 0
- The t-test for inferring whether two groups differ from one another
- The paired t-test as a first glimpse at how we might account for participant-level random effects (see Chapter 7).

‚ö†Ô∏è Accident report: Once you have the basic t-test under your belt, it might feel natural to compare each group to 0 and conclude that one group is different from 0 and the other one isn‚Äôt. But ‚Äúthe difference between significant and not significant is not necessarily itself statistically significant‚Äù (Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann, and Wagenmakers 2011).

How to go from theory to hypotheses to statistical model

- Discrete data and logistic regression. Same thing, different linking function. (lead-in to GLM: probit, Poisson, beta, etc.).

Multilevel regression models of a difference between two groups, controlling for experimental items and subject

  - Sidebar: what should you control for? Different subcultures in psychology either post-hoc control for or look for moderation by demographic factors. We discuss the consequences of these decisions for both precision and causal inference. 

Causality revisited: what can and can‚Äôt be concluded from an experiment

::: {.accident-report}
‚ö†Ô∏è Accident report: Mediation going wrong: even when you have a randomized experiment, you can still mess up your causal inference (Montgomery, Nyhan, and Torres 2018). 
:::

- Dropping subjects who fail a manipulation check can be problematic (Aronow, Baron, and Pinson 2019).
- Mediation requires more confounding assumptions than causal inference about total effects, and these assumptions may be violated even in randomized experiments. 


Estimating one quantity in isolation is often not the best thing to do. In almost any experiment, there will be variation in the estimate that has to do with other known sources. Imagine the Stroop effect, which has a fairly consistent effect on both fast and slow readers [@haaf2017]. But estimates of this effect will be more precise if we take into account that some readers are slower or faster, rather than just averaging across all this variation. That's why we need models that take into account different sources of variation.

<!-- ‚å®Ô∏è Interactive: Nonparameteric resampling under the null -->

<!-- As we've seen above, hypothesis testing hinges on approximating the null distribution of the statistical estimate. In the examples above, it was easy to use statistical theory to work out the null distribution: for example, in Figure \@ref(fig:inference-null-model), we knew that the null distribution must be binomial since we had a binary outcome, and the binomial distribution parameter $p$ must be 0.5, because that is what the null says.  -->

<!-- But sometimes we don't know what the null distribution would look like. Suppose we want to estimate group differences in a highly skewed continuous outcome, like salary, but we had a small sample size (e.g., $n=10$ per group): -->

<!-- ```{r inference-permutation-1, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- print(d) -->

<!-- set.seed(451) -->
<!-- n.per.group = 10 -->
<!-- d = data.frame( Y = c( rexp( n = n.per.group, rate = 4 ), -->
<!--                        rexp( n = n.per.group, rate = 4 ) + 0.3 ), -->
<!--                 Group = c( rep( "Control", n.per.group ), -->
<!--                            rep ( "Treatment", n.per.group ) ) ) -->

<!-- colors = c("black", "orange") -->
<!-- ggplot( data = d, -->
<!--         aes(x = Y, group = Group ) ) + -->

<!--   #geom_histogram( aes(fill = Group), alpha = 0.4 ) + -->
<!--   geom_dotplot( aes( fill=Group ), alpha=0.4, binwidth = .05 ) + -->
<!--   scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + -->

<!--   theme_bw() + xlab("Y") + -->
<!--   ylab("")  -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We can't proceed with a t-test in good conscience because, with only $n=20$, we can't necessarily trust that the Central Limit Theorem has "kicked in" sufficiently for the test to work despite the skewness. Stated otherwise, we can't be sure that the null distribution is normal in this case.  -->

<!-- When we can't rely on theory, another way to approximate a null distribution is through nonparameteric resampling. "Resampling" means that we're going to cleverly draw new samples *from our existing sample*, and "nonparametric" means that we will do this in a way that obviates assumptions about the shape of the null distribution (in contrast to parameteric approaches that do rely on such assumptions). -->

<!-- The central idea is that, if the treatment truly had no effect on the outcome, then the observations would be *exchangeable* between the treatment and control groups. That is, there would not be systematic differences between the treatment and control groups. This may or may not be true in our observed sample (after all, that's why we're doing a hypothesis test in the first place), but we could draw new samples from our existing sample in a manner that forces exchangeability. In this case, we could randomly permute the column of outcomes in our dataset while leaving the column of treatment assignments fixed: -->

<!-- ```{r inference-permutation-2, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # show construction of a single permuted dataset -->
<!-- # library(modelr) -->
<!-- # library(purrr) -->
<!-- perm.reps = 100 -->
<!-- perms = permute(data = d, n = perm.reps, Y) -->

<!-- # show the first permuted dataset -->
<!-- print( perms$perm[[1]]$data ) -->

<!-- #@WHY ARE THESE ALL THE SAME?? -->
<!-- cbind( perms$perm[[1]]$data$Y, perms$perm[[2]]$data$Y ) -->
<!-- # c.f. package example for debugging -->
<!-- perms2 <- permute(mtcars,  1000, mpg) -->
<!-- cbind( perms2$perm[[1]]$data$mpg, perms2$perm[[2]]$data$mpg ) -->
<!-- # also the same??  -->

<!-- # get group mean differences for each permutation via OLS -->
<!-- ols = map(perms$perm, ~ lm(Y ~ 1, data = .)) -->
<!-- ATEs = lapply( ols, function(.ols) as.numeric( coef(.ols)["(Intercept)"] ) ) -->

<!-- # now plot the ATEs to show the null sampling distribution -->
