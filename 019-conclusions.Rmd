## Lessons for individual researchers

Concrete suggestions for building a cumulative research program

- This was a big book, and incorporating all of this advice into your research program may seem difficult or overwhelming.
- Start simple, and repeat: for building an empirical research program, you want to measure one thing well and then build on that measurement. 
- Internal replication as a critical way to check your own work. 
- Cumulativity as a key principle that you can model in your own work. 





## Lessons for the field of psychology

Revisiting themes of precision, transparency, generalizability, bias-reduction

- Discuss the ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù narrative and reframe as one way into seeing the set of interlocking issues that keep behavioral research from contributing to cumulative theory.
- Collaboration as a way forward. Spotlight the Psychological Science Accelerator (Moshontz et al. 2018).
