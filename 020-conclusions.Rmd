How to run a study that doesn’t replicate, and how to design a study that doesn’t contribute to our knowledge. We report new empirical analysis of aggregate data from 10 years of Psych 251 (>100 replication projects), discussing empirical predictors of (non-)replicability

Revisiting themes of precision, transparency, generalizability, bias-reduction

- Discuss the “crisis” narrative and reframe as one way into seeing the set of interlocking issues that keep behavioral research from contributing to cumulative theory.
- Collaboration as a way forward. Spotlight the Psychological Science Accelerator (Moshontz et al. 2018).

Concrete suggestions for building a cumulative research program

- This was a big book, and incorporating all of this advice into your research program may seem difficult or overwhelming.
- Start simple, and repeat: for building an empirical research program, you want to measure one thing well and then build on that measurement. 
- Internal replication as a critical way to check your own work. 
- Cumulativity as a key principle that you can model in your own work.
