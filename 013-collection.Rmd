* Review best practices for online and in person data collection
* Implement data integrity checks, manipulation checks, and pilot testing
:::

You have selected your measure and manipulation and planned your sample. Your preregistration is set. Now it's time to think about the nuts and bolts of collecting data. While the details of data collection may vary from context to context and sample to sample, this chapter will highlight some general best practices for the data collection process. We organize these practices around two perspectives: the participant and the researcher.

The first and second sections take the perspective of a participant. We begin by reviewing the importance of informed consent. Consent is a key part of running experiments that respect the autonomy of their participants. When we neglect the impact of our research on the populations we study, we not only violate our governing principles and bodies (like the Belmont Report and our institutional review board, respectively) that guide the work we do, but we also establish a pattern of imbalance and distrust that hinders our efforts. Next, we will take a look at a few vulnerable populations represented in research, and describe the steps to take that ensure appropriate and equitable participation for all who wish to do so. 
In the second section, we discuss how experimental designs look to participants, reviewing some concerns regarding how to provide a positive experience for participants in both in-person and online experiments. 

We then end by taking the experimenter's perspective, asking how we can collect high quality data. We review some best practices in pilot testing, discussing how to structure pilots to get maximal information from participants. We end by reviewing best practices regarding the inclusion of manipulation and attention checks.

🔬 Case study: The rise of online data collection

Since the rise of experimental psychology laboratories in university settings during the period after World War 2 [@benjamin-jr2000], experiments have typically been conducted by recruiting participants from what has been referred to as the "subject pool." This term denotes a group of people who can be recruited for experiments, typically students from introductory psychology courses [@sieber1989] recruited via the requirement that students complete a certain quantity of experiments as part of their course work.^[At various times, students have raised ethical concerns about these requirements as being coercive of participation in precisely the way that should be off limits for psychology experiments (see Chapter \@ref(ethics)). As a result, most programs now provide some more or less onerous alternative to participation.] The ready availability of this convenience population led inevitably to the massive over-representation of US undergraduates in published psychology research, in turn leading to persistent critiques of this practice as undermining the generalizability psychological research [@sears1986;@henrich2010].

Yet in the period 2005--2015, there has been a revolution in data collection from convenience populations. Instead of focusing on university undergraduates, increasingly, published psychology work uses convenience samples of online workers recruited from crowdsourcing sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and Prolific Academic. Originally designed to distribute micro-payments to workers for business purposes like retyping receipts, these services have become marketplaces to connect researchers with research participants who are willing to complete surveys and experimental tasks for small payments [@litman2017]. As of 2015, more than a third of studies in top social and personality psychology journals were conducted on crowdsourcing platforms (another third were still conducted with college undergraduates) [@anderson2019] and this proportion is likely continuing to grow.

Initially, many researchers worried that crowdsourced data from online convenience samples would lead to a decrease in data quality. Yet in study after study, data quality was found to be comparable to in-lab convenience samples [@mason2012;@buhrmester2016]. In one particularly compelling demonstration, a set of browser-based experiments were used to replicate a group of classic phenomena in cognitive psychology, with compelling successes on every experiment except those requiring sub-50 millisecond stimulus presentation [@crump2013]. Further, as we discuss below, researchers have learned to pay greater attention to how to ensure that online participants understand and comply with the instructions in complex experimental tasks.

Since these initial successes, however, attention has moved away from the validity of online experiments to the ethical challenges of engaging with crowdworkers. In 2020, nearly 130,000 people completed MTurk studies [@moss2020]. Of those, 70% identified as White, 56% identified as women, and 48% had an annual household income below $50,000. A sampling of crowd work determined that the average wage earned was just \$2.00 per hour, and less than 5% of workers were paid at least the federal minimum wage [@hara2018]. Further, many experimenters routinely withheld payment from workers based on their performance in experiments. These practices clearly violate ethical guidelines for research with human participants, but are often overlooked by institutional review boards because participants are offered as a "service" rather than being paid directly, or because the platforms were unfamiliar to ethics reviewers. 

With greater attention to the conditions of workers [e.g., @salehi2015], best practices for online researcher have progressed considerably. As we describe below, working with online populations requires attention to both standard ethical issues of consent and compensation, as well as new issues around the "user experience" of participating in research. The availability of online convenience samples can be transformative for the pace of research -- running large studies in a single day rather than many months. But such populations are vulnerable in different ways than university convenience samples, and we must take care to ensure that research online is conducted ethically.

## Informed consent and debriefing

As we discussed in Chapter \@ref(ethics), experimenters must respect the autonomy of their participants. Respect for agency means that participants must be informed about the risks and benefits of participation before they agree to participate. It also means that researchers must discuss and contextualize the study afterwards through debriefing. We discuss each of these processes in turn. We end by discussing the special protections that are required to protect the autonomy of vulnerable populations.

### Getting consent

Before we run any experiment, participants must give consent. In the US regulatory framework, there are clear guidelines about what the process of giving consent looks like. They typically center around the **consent form**: a document that lays out the risks and benefits of the study and asks for participants' signature as a mark of their understanding and consent to participate. Ultimately, your drafted consent form will need to be reviewed by your IRB office, and they can advise you on whether you have adequately described all important information for participants to review. 

```{r collection-consent-requirements}
tribble(~` `, ~Requirements, 
        1, "A statement that the study involves research",
        2, "An explanation of the purposes of the research",
        3, "The expected duration of the subject's participation",
        4, "A description of the procedures to be followed",
        5, "Identification of any procedures which are experimental",
        6, "A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject",
        7, "A description of any benefits to the subject or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research",
        8, "A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject",

  knitr::kable(caption = "US Office of Human Research Protections requirements for a consent form ( edited for length).")
```

Consent forms have very specific elements that are required, including explanations of the research and its procedures, description of risks and benefits, and explanation that participation is voluntary. Table \@ref(tab:collection-consent-requirements) gives the full list of consent form requirements given by the US Office for Human Research Protections. 

Given how much must be stated in a consent form, some experimenters worry about demand characteristics (discussed in Chapter \@ref(design)). In some cases, understanding the precise goals of a study may change the result of the study. But the goal of a consent form is typically not to explain the motivation of the research design as much as the topic of the study and the procedures that a participant will undergo. When providing consent information, researchers should focus on what someone might think or feel as a result of participating in the study. Are there any physical or emotional risks associated? What should someone know about the study that may give them pause about agreeing to participate in the first place? Our advice is to center the participant in the consent process rather than the research question. Information about research goals can be provided during debriefing. 

### Prerequisites of consent

In order to give consent, participants must have the cognitive capacity to make decisions (competence), understand what they are being asked to do (comprehension), and know that they have the right to withdraw consent at any time (voluntariness) [@kadam2017]. 

Establishing competence is the first prerequisite of informed consent. Typically we assume competence for adult volunteers in our experiments, but in the case that we are working with children or other vulnerable populations (see below), we may need to consider whether they are legally competent to provide consent. Participants who cannot consent on their own should still be informed about participation in your experiment. If possible, obtain **assent**, or agreement to participate, when a person has no legal ability to consent, and respect their decision if they choose not to assent -- even if you previously obtained consent.

The second prerequisite is comprehension. It is a good practice to review consent forms verbally with participants, especially if the study is involved and takes place in person. The consent form itself must be readable for a broad audience, meaning care should be taken to use accessible language and clear formatting. Consider giving participants a copy of the consent form in advance so they can read at their own pace, think of any outstanding questions they might have, and decide how to proceed without any chance of coercion [@young1990]. 

Finally, participants must understand that their involvement is voluntary, meaning that they are under no obligation to be involved in a study: signing a consent form does not waive their right to withdraw at any time. Experimenters should not only state that participation is voluntary, they should also pay attention to other features of the study environment that migth lead to  **structural coercion** [@fisher2013]. High levels of compensation can make it difficult for lower-income participants to withdraw from research. Similarly, factors like race, gender, and social class can lead participants to feel discomfort around discontinuing a study. It is incumbent on experimenters to provide a comfortable study environment and to avoid such coercive factors wherever possible. 

### Debriefing participants

Once a study is completed, researchers should always debrief participants. A debriefing is composed of four parts: (1) participation gratitude, (2) discussion of goals, (3) explanation of deception, and (4) questions and clarification [@allen2017]. Together these serve to contextualize the experience for the participant and to mitigate any potential harms from the study.

1. **Gratitude.** Thank participants for their involvement in research study! Sometimes thanks is enough (for a short experiment), but many studies also include monetary compensation or course credit. Compensation should be commensurate with the amount of time and effort required for participation. Compensation structures vary widely from place to place; typically local IRBs will have guidelines that they ask researchers to comply with.

2. **Discussion of goals.** Researchers should briefly share the purpose of the research study with participants. Why were participants recruited for this study in the first place? What are the researchers hoping to learn by conducting this study? It is important to ensure that participants fully understand the goals of the study, so avoiding technical jargon or confusing language is critical. You might also consider sharing any preliminary findings or where to find the completed write-up at the study's conclusion -- many engaged participants appreciate learning about research findings, even months or years after participation.^[Sharing goals is especially important when some aspect of the study appears evaluative -- participants will often be interested in knowing how well they preformed against their peers. For example, a parent whose child completed a word-recognition task may request information about their child's performance. It is often important to highlight that the goals of the study are not about individual evaluation and ranking.] 

3. **Explanation of deception.** Researchers must reveal any deception during debriefing, regardless of how minor the deception seems to the researcher. This component of the debriefing process can be thought of as "dehoaxing" because it is meant to illuminate any aspects of the study that were previously misleading or inaccurate [@holmes1976]. The goal is both to reveal the true intent of the study and to alleviate any potential anxiety associated with the deception. Experimenters should make clear both where in the study the deception occurred and why the deception was necessary for the study's success. 

4. **Questions and clarification.** Finally, researchers should answer any questions or address any concerns raised by participants. Many researchers use this opportunity to first ask participants about their interpretation of the study, what they thought were the study goals. This practice not only illuminates aspects of the study design that may have been unclear to or hidden from participants, it also begins a discussion where both researchers and participants can communicate about this joint experience. This step is also helpful in identifying negative emotions or feelings resulting from the study [@allen2017]. When participants do express negative emotions, researchers are responsible for sharing resources participants can use to work though the discomfort. 

### Special considerations for vulnerable populations

Regardless of who is participating in research, investigators have an obligation to protect the rights and well-being of all participants. However, some populations are considered especially **vulnerable** because of their decreased agency -- either in general or in the face of potentially coercive situations. Research with these populations receives additional oversight. In this section, we will consider several vulnerable populations.

**Children.** Children are some of the most commonly used vulnerable populations in research because the study of development can contribute both to chilren's welfare and to our understanding of the human mind. In the US, children under the age of 18 may only participate in research with written consent from a parent or guardian. Unless they are pre-verbal, children should additionally be asked for thier assent. The risks associated with a research study focusing on children also must be no greater than minimal unless participants may receive some direct benefit from participating or participating in the study may improve a disorder or condition of which the participant was formally diagnosed. 

**People with disabilities.** There are thousands of disabilities that affect cognition, development, motor ability, communication, and decision-making with varying degrees of interference, so it is first important to remember that considerations for this population will be just as diverse as its members. Roughly 8% of the US population is disabled, which makes it likely that, in the context of a research study, researchers may come into contact with someone who is disabled. No laws  preclude people with disabilities from participating in research. However, those with cognitive disabilities who are unable to make their own decisions  may only participant with written consent from a legal guardian and with their individual assent (if applicable). Those retaining full cognitive capacity but who have other disabilities that make it challenging to participate normally in the research study should receive appropriate accommodations to access the material, including the study's risks and benefits. 

**Incarcerated populations.** Nearly 2.1 million people are incarcerated in the United States alone [@gramlich2021]. Due to early (and repugnant) use of prisoners as a convenience population that could not provide consent, the use of prisoners in research has been a key focus of protective efforts. The US Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) supports their involvement under very limited circumstances -- typically when the research specifically focuses on issues relevant to incarcerated populations [@ohrp2003]. When researchers propose to study incarcerated individuals, the IRB must reconfigure their board to include at least one active prisoner (or someone who can speak from a prisoner's perspective) and ensure that less than half of the board has any affiliation to the prison system, public or private.  Importantly, researchers must not suggest or promise that participation will have any bearing on prison sentences or parole eligibility, and compensation must be otherwise commensurate with their contribution. A question you might ask when determining whether a study involving incarcerated individuals is appropriate is, "Would a reasonable adult participate if they were not imprisoned?"

**Low-income populations.** Low-income populations are exceptional cases because any one person can easily fall under this category in addition to another. Participants with fewer resources may be more persuaded to participate by monetary incentives, creating a potentially coercive situation. Researchers should consult with their IRB to conform to local standards for non-coercive payment. 

**Crowdworkers.** As discussed above, crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk have become increasingly prominent as a population in psychology research. IRBs do not consider crowdworkers as a specific vulnerable population, but many of the same concerns about diminished autonomy and greater need for protection can arise. Without platform or IRB standards, it is up to individual experimenters to commit to fair pay, which should likely be at a bare minimum the applicable minimum wage (e.g., the US federal minimum wage). Further, in the context of reputation management systems like those of Amazon Mechanical Turk, participants can be penalized for withdrawing from an experiment -- once they have their work "rejected" by an experimenter, it can be harder for them to find new jobs, causing serious long-term harm to their ability to earn on the platform. 

## The participants' experience

Standard ethical frameworks govern certain aspects of human experiments, including the consent process and the approval of risks and benefits for studies. These protections were initially conceptualized for biomedical research in which participation in an experiment carries a significant time commitment as well as substantial risks. In contrast, most lab-based psychology experiments are shorter and less risky, often involving filling out questionnaires, interacting with an experimenter or peer, or giving speeded responses on a computer. And the kinds of experiments that are run in the thousands on crowdsourcing platforms have very different profiles still. They are typically short, carry small amounts of compensation, and carry very limited quantifiable risks. 

For the majority of psychology experiments, the biggest factor that governs whether a participant has a positive or negative experience of an experiment is not its risk profile, since this is minimal.^[There are of course exceptions, including research with more sensitive content. Even in these cases, however, attention to the participant's experience can be important for ensuring good scientific outcomes.] Instead, it is the participants' experience. Did they feel welcome? Did they understand the instructions? Did the software work as designed? Was their compensation clearly described and promptly delivered? These aspects of "user experience" are critical both for ensuring that participants have a good experience in the study (an ethical imperative) and for gathering good data. Unhappy participants compromise both the ethical and scientific goals of research. 

### When to collect data online?

Online data collection is increasingly ubiquitous in the behavioral sciences. Further, the web browser –- alongside survey software like Qualtrics or packages like jsPsych [@de-leeuw2015] –- can be a major aid to transparency in sharing experimental materials. Replication and reuse of experimental materials is vastly simpler if readers and reviewers can click on a link and share the same experience as a participant in your experiment. Still, online data collection is not right for every experiment. We discuss three concerns for online data collection: (1) population availability, (2) the availability of particular manipulations and measures, and (3) the reliability and validity of online data collection. 

**Population**. The first key question to answer is whether the population of interest for an experiment is even available online. Initially, convenience samples from Amazon Mechanical Turk were the only group that was easily available. The demographics of this group are more diverse than some might expect [@moss2020]. More recently, new tools have emerged to allow demographic pre-screening of crowd participants, including using sites like Cloud Research and Prolific, which offer more granular participant screening mechanisms as well as greater participant reputation controls [@eyal2021;@peer2021]. These tools still have significant weaknesses for accessing socio-demographically diverse populations within and outside the US, however -- screening tools can remove participants, but if the underlying population does not contain many participants from a particular demographic, it can be hard to gather large enough samples.^[For an example of using crowdsourcing and social media sites to gather diverse participants, see @demayo2021.] 

Increasingly, specialty recruitment platforms are growing to meet this challenge. Specialty survey research companies, such as Qualtrics Panels, can be used to recruit samples with specific demographic profiles for simple experiments. And it may initially have seemed implausible that children could be recruited online, but during the COVID-19 pandemic a substantial amount of developmental data collection moved online, with many studies yielding comparable results [e.g., @chuey2021]. Sites like [LookIt](http://lookit.mit.edu) now offer sophisticated platforms for hosting studies for children and families [@scott2017]. Finally, new, non-US crowdsourcing platforms continue to grow in popularity, leading to greater global diversity in the available online populations. 

Online participant recruitment tools continue to grow and change, and it is likely that in the near future, many populations will be accessible online. However, researchers recruiting participants online should keep in mind the fundamental fact that  the specific characteristics that lead a particular person to work part- or full-time on a crowdsourcing platform likely mean that they are not representative of the broader population. Unfortunately, similar caveats hold true for in-person convenience samples (see Chapter \@ref(sampling)). Ultimately, researchers must reason about what their generalization goal is and whether that is consistent with the samples they can access online. 

**Manipulation and measure**. A second question is whether the particular manipulation and measures for your experiment can be deployed online. 
Can your measure be collected when collected online? 

Will online data collection yield reliable and valid data? 




- Validating the process of collecting data online. We briefly review studies suggesting that for general data collection across many paradigms, online data collection is valid. 

- When is online not enough? We describe cases where in-person data collection is necessary, highlighting psychophysical and physiological measurement and social interaction as two common classes of experiments that still cannot be done effectively online. 

User testing. "


Some studies may not be ethically appropriate for being run online. Studies that have substantial deception or that induce negative emotions may require an experimenter present to alleviate concerns and address points of deception rather than relying on a written statement.

### Ensuring good experiences for in-lab participants

A participant's experience for an in-lab study begins with their recruitment and continues with their transit to the site of the research. It is perhaps obvious but worth stating that each of these experiences contribute to the success of your experiment. If you have participants with incorrect expectations about the topic or compensation for research, or if communication and scheduling is frustrating, then you can expect their attitude towards the study will start out negative. Similarly, if the experience of finding the study location or parking nearby is difficult, their interaction with the experiment may be affected by these challenges.^[All of us have worked in a building that is notoriously difficult to navigate. This seemingly minor issue has resulted in a substantial number of late, frustrated, and flustered participants over the years.] Anything you can do to make these experiences smoother and more predicable -- prompt communication, well-tested directions, reserved parking slots, etc. -- will increase the quality of your data. 

Once a participant enters the lab, every aspect of the interaction with the experimenter can have an effect on their measured behavior. A vast literature also suggests that various aspects of social interaction facilitate compliance -- both in an experimental interaction and beyond [@gass2018]! Creating an environment that facilitates compliance with the experimental procedure -- whether through the simple expedient of making eye-contact with the participant or through the broader range of persuasive strategies [@cialdini2004] -- should lead to a better result as long as it is deployed equally across conditions. 

Standardization is the key concern balancing a warmer and more interactive experience for in-lab experiments. As much as possible, any interaction with participants should be scripted and standardized. Doing otherwise may result in differential treatment for participants with different characteristics, which could in turn result in greater variability in outcomes or even sociodemographic biases reflected in data. Even more importantly, such interactions should be undertaken with condition masked to the experimenter. Otherwise, as we reviewed in Chapter \@ref(design), it is extremely easy for these interactions to result in substantial experimenter expectancy effects! Even if the experimenter must know condition assignment for a participant -- as is sometimes the case -- this information should be revealed at the last possible moment to avoid contamination of other aspects of the experimental session.^[In some experiments, an experimenter delivers a manipulation and hence it cannot be masked from them. In such cases, it's common to have two experimenters such that one delivers the manipulation and another (masked to condition) collect the measurement. This situation often comes up with studies of infancy, since stimuli are often delivered via an in-person puppet show; at a minimum, behavior should be coded by someone other than the puppeteer.]

### Ensuring good experiences for online participants

The design challenges for online experiments are very different than for in-lab experiments. Experimenter expectancy and variability are almost completely eliminated, removing concerns about bias. On the other hand, many Turkers multi-task and do tens of HITs for many hours a day. It can be much harder to induce a particular state of interest when your manipulation is one of dozens the participant has experienced that day and where your interactions with them are mediated by a browser window. When creating an online experimental experience, we consider four issues: (1) design, (2) communication, (3) payment policies, and (4) effective consent and debriefing. 

**Design for online experiments**. If your web experiment is unpleasant to interact with, participants will likely become confused and frustrated. They will either drop out or provide data that are lower quality. Good experiment design online is a subset of good web and interaction design more generally. A good interface should be clean and well-tested and should offer clear affordances for interaction. As a simple example, if a participant presses a key at an appropriate time, the experiment should offer a response -- otherwise the participant will likely press it again. If the participant is uncertain how many trials are left, they may be more likely to drop out of the experiment. And if they are performing a speeded paradigm, they should receive practice trials to ensure that they understand the controls of the experiment and the instructions prior to beginning the critical blocks of trials. 

**Communication**. Many online studies run through platforms like Mechanical Turk involve almost no contact with participants. When participants do communicate it is very important to be responsive and polite, since -- unlike the typical undergraduate participant -- the work that a crowdworker is doing for your study may be part of how they earn their livelihood. A small issue in the study for you may feel very important for them. For that reason, rapid resolution of issues with studies -- typically through appropriate compensation -- is very important. Increasingly, crowdworkers track the reputation of specific labs and experimenters [@irani2013]. A quick and generous response to an issue will ensure that future crowdworkers do not avoid your studies. 

**Payment policies**. Many crowdworkers doing online experiments use their payments as part of their primary income stream. As a result, unclear or punitive payment policies can have a major impact. We strongly recommend always paying workers if they complete your experiment, regardless of result. This policy is comparable to standard payment policies for in-lab work. We assume good faith in our participants: if someone comes to the lab, they are paid for the experiment, even if it turns out that they did not perform correctly. The major counterargument to this policy is that some online marketplaces have a population of workers who are looking to cheat by being non-compliant with the experiment (e.g., entering gibberish or even using scripts to progress quickly through studies). Our recommendation is to address this issue through instruction, attention, and manipulation checks (as discussed below) such that the easiest way for a participant to complete your experiment is to comply with your instructions.

```

**Consent and debriefing**. Finally, because online studies are typically fully automated, participants do not have a chance to interact with researchers around consent and debriefing. Further, engagement with long consent forms may be minimal. In our work we have typically relied on short consent statements like the one from our class, shown in  Table \@ref(tab:collection-online-consent). Similarly, debriefing often occurs through a set of pages that summarize all four components of the debriefing process (participation gratitude, discussion of goals, explanation of deception, and questions and clarification). 

## Ensuring high quality data

In the final section of this chapter, we review some key practices surrounding data collection that can help to collect high quality datasets while respecting our ethical obligations to participants. By "high quality," here we especially mean datasets that are uncontaminated by a variety of experimental artifacts due to factors like misunderstanding of instructions, fatigue, incomprehension, or intentional neglect of the experimental task. 

We'll begin by discussing the issue of **pilot testing**; we recommend a systematic procedure for piloting that can maximize the chance of collecting high quality data. next, we'll discuss the practice of checking participants' comprehension and attention and what such checks should and shouldn't be used for. 

### Best practices for pilot studies

A **pilot study** is a small study conducted before you collect your main sample. Smooth and successful data collection is typically difficult without piloting, at least the first time you do an experiment of a given type. Fundamentally, experiments induce a particular experience in their participants, and careful attention to the nature of that experience^[Even if the experience is somewhat tedious, like searching for a T amongst Ls for hundreds of trials!] requires iterative development. 

Pilot studies cannot tell you about expected effect size (as we discussed in Chapter \@ref(sampling)). They also cannot tell you about the significance of your main result. What they *can* do is tell you about whether your paradigm works. They can reveal:
* if your code crashes under certain circumstances
* if your instructions confuse a substantial portion of your participants
* if you have a very high dropout rate
* if your data collection procedure fails to log variables of interest
* if participants are disgruntled by the end of the experiment

We recommend that all experimenters do -- at the very minimum -- two pilot studies before they launch their experiment. 

The first pilot study, **pilot A**^[Good name, right?], is a test with non-naive participants. Your parents can do this experiment, or in a pinch you can run yourself a bunch of times (though this isn't preferable because you're likely to miss a lot of aspects of the experience that you are habituated to, especially if you've been debugging the software). The goal of pilot A is to ensure that your experiment is comprehensible, that participants can complete it, and that the data are logged appropriately. This last goal means that you must *analyze* the data from pilot A, at least to the point of checking that the relevant data about each trial is logged.^[At a minimum, for each trial you need to know a subject ID, a trial ID, the state of any manipulation (condition, trial type, etc.), and the value for the measure.] 

The second pilot study, **pilot B**, consists of a test of a small set of naive participants. Pilot size will depend on the costliness of running the experiment (in time, money, and opportunity cost) as well as your worries about the paradigm. If we're talking about a short online survey experiment, then running a pilot of 10--20 people is reasonable. A more extensive laboratory study might be better served by piloting just two or three people. The goal of this second study is to understand properties of the participant experience: for example, were they confused? Did they withdraw before the study finished? You won't have the numbers to make robust statistical inferences about these questions, but even a small number of pilots can tell you that your dropout rate is likely too high: if 5 of 10 pilot participants withdraw you may need to reconsider aspects of your design. It's critical for pilot B  that you debrief more extensively with your participants. This debriefing often takes the form of an interview questionnaire after the study is over ("what did you think the study was about?" and "is there any way we could improve the experience of being in the study?" can be helpful questions). 

Piloting is often an iterative process. We frequently launch studies for a pilot B, then recognise from the data or from participant feedback that they can be improved. We make tweaks and pilot again. Be careful not to overfit to small differences in pilot data -- the samples are small and so inferences will not be robust. The process should be more like workshopping a manuscript to remove typos and make it read better than doing a study.

In the case of especially expensive experiments, it can be a dilemma whether to run a larger pilot to identify difficulties since such a pilot will be costly. In these cases, one possibility can be to preregister a contingent strategy. For example, in a planned sample of 100 participants, you could preregister running 20 as a pilot sample with the stipulation that you will look only at their dropout rate and not at any condition differences in the target measure. Then the registration could state that if the dropout rate is lower than 25%, you will collect the next 80 participants and analyze the whole dataset including the initial pilot. This sort of registration can help you split the difference between cautious piloting and conservation of rare or costly data.

## Chapter summary: Data collection

In this chapter, we took the perspective of both the participant and the researcher. Our goal was to discuss how to achieve a good research outcome for both. On the side of the participant, we highlighted the responsibility of the experimenter to ensure a robust consent and debriefing process. We also discussed the importance of a good experimental experience in the lab and online -- ensuring that the experiment is not only conducted ethically but is also pleasant to participate in. Finally, we discussed how to address some concerns about data quality from the researcher perspective, addressing both pilot testing and the use of attention and manipulation checks.
