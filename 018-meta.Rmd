:::

Throughout this book, we have focused on the importance of using experiments to estimate effects. Our focus has been on design decisions that maximize the precision of our estimates and minimizes their bias. But even when we do our best to get a precise, unbiased estimate of effect size, we also must acknowledge the role of participant, stimulus, and methodological variability in limiting both the precision and the generalizability of our estimates. 

Both before and after conducting an experiment, a review of the literature is a critical tool for understanding sources of variation in a particular effect of interest. The term "review" might sound like you throw a search term into Google Scholar, download articles that look topical or interesting, spend a few days reading those articles, and then write a summary. While this ad-hoc technique is one of many ways of performing a review of the literature [@grant2009typology], it doesn't provide any kind of quantitative expectation about a particular effect. Further, it doesn't tell you anything about potential biases in the literature -- for example, a bias for the publication of positive effects. 

To address these questions, a more systematic, quantitative review of the literature is required. This chapter focuses on a specific type of quantitative review called **meta-analysis**. Meta-analysis is a method for combining effect sizes across different measurements. (If you need a refresher on effect size, flip back to Chapter \@ref(estimation), where we introduce the concept.^[We'll exclusively be using Cohen's $d$, the standardized difference between means, which we introduced in Chapter \@ref(estimation). There are many more varieties of effect size available, but we focus here on $d$ because it's common and easy to reason about in the context of the statistical tools we introduced in the earlier sections of the book.]

By combining information from multiple studies, meta-analysis often provides more precise estimates of an effect size than any single study. In addition, meta-analysis also allows the researcher to look at the extent to which an effect varies  across studies. If an effect does vary across studies, meta-analysis also can be used to test whether certain study characteristics systematically produce different results (e.g., whether an effect is larger in certain populations).

🔬 Case study: Hotel towel reuse

Imagine you are staying in a hotel and you have just taken a shower. Do you throw the towels on the floor or hang them back up again? In a widely-cited study on the power of describing social norms, @goldstein2008room provided a message that "most other guests reuse their towels." Across two studies, they found that guests were significantly more likely to reuse their towels after receiving the social norm message than a control (Study 1: $p = .05$, Study 2: $p = .03$). 

Unfortunately, five subsequent studies testing whether social norm messages increased hotel towel reuse all failed to reject the null hypothesis (all $p$s $> .05$). You might conclude that these studies indicate that social norm messages do not reliably impact towel reuse. You might even go a step further and try to think of explanations for why one team found the effect, but others did not. (Maybe the messages change behavior when guest receive nice fluffy towels, but not when they  receive cheap, low-quality towels.) 

Yet when the evidence was combined in a meta-analysis, @scheibehenne2016 found that the results across these studies were, for the most part, quite consistent. Participants who received a social norm message were slightly more likely to reuse their towels in four out of five of the studies -- but most of the studies simply did not have large enough samples for this difference to be statistically significant. When combined, however, meta-analysis indicated that social norm messages did have a significant overall effect on hotel towel reuse. Although each study was likely under-powered to detect the true effect, on the balance it appears that the social norm message does make a difference. 
:::

Meta-analysis often teaches us something about a body of evidence that we do not intuitively grasp when we casually read through a bunch of articles. Merely reading all the studies that tested the effect of social norm messaging on hotel towel re-use would give the impression that the effect is (at best) unreliable. But meta-analysis indicated that the results across studies are not as inconsistent as they seem -- and that social norm messaging did decrease towel re-use overall.^[Given the number of hotel bookings worldwide -- 1.7 billion in the European Union alone in 2013 [@kotzeva2015eurostat] -- the insight provided by the meta-analysis is not trivial!]

## The basics of evidence synthesis

The hotel towel example is a good starting point but there is much more we can do with meta-analysis. To illustrate, we'll turn to another example: a meta-analysis of an idea called the "contact hypothesis." According to the contact hypothesis, prejudice can be reduced when members of majority and minority groups come together in the pursuit of a common goal [@allport1954nature]. 

To examine whether this type of intergroup contact can mitigate prejudice in real-world contexts, @paluck2019contact performed a meta-analysis of studies that tested the effects of randomly-assigned intergroup contact interventions on prejudice-related outcomes. The starting point of their analysis was to identify all of the published papers that randomly assigned participants to intergroup contact situations and measured outcomes after a delay. They then did the hard work of extracting effect size estimates from each of these papers. Because not every paper reports standardized effect sizes -- or even means and standard deviations for every group -- this process can often involve scraping information from plots, tables, and statistical tests to try and reconstruct effect sizes.

<!-- Cohen's $d$ -- which, if you recall from Chapter \@ref(estimation), represents the standardized mean difference -- was used as the effect size index. As we show in the remainder of the chapter, the meta-analytic tools @paluck2019contact used provide several useful insights about this proposed prejudice-reduction intervention. -->

### How not to synthesize evidence

Many people's first instinct for evidence synthesis is to count how many studies support versus did not support the hypothesis under investigation. This technique usually amounts to counting the number of studies with "significant" $p$-values, since (for better or for worse) "significance" is largely what drives the take-home conclusions researchers report [@mcshane2017statistical; @nelson1986interpretation]. In meta-analysis, we call this practice of counting the number of significant $p$-values **vote-counting** [@borenstein2021introduction]. 

For example, in the @paluck2019contact meta-analysis, all studies yielded positive effect sizes, but only approximately `r sum(DF$sig)` of `r nrow(DF)` were significant. So, based on this vote-count, we would have the impression that most studies do not support the contact hypothesis.

Many literature reviews use this vote-counting approach -- albeit often not explicitly. Despite its intuitive appeal, vote-counting can be very misleading: it characterizes evidence solely in terms of dichotomized $p$-values, while entirely ignoring effect sizes. In Chapter \@ref(replication), we saw how this fetishism of statistical significance can mislead us when we consider individual studies. These problems are even worse when they are multiplied across studies. 

For example, small studies on large effects may consistently produce non-significant effects that, when combined in a large meta-analysis, provide good evidence of an effect (as with the hotel towels). Inversely, it is also possible for a meta-analysis not to provide strong evidence of an effect despite several studies finding statistically significant effects. In these cases, vote-counting can lead us badly astray [@borenstein2021introduction]. To avoid these pitfalls, meta-analysis combines the effect sizes estimates from each study, weighting them in a principled way.

### Fixed effects meta-analysis

If vote-counting is a bad idea, how should we combine results across studies? The next simplest way might be to average effect sizes from each study. Let's take a look at the effects that @paluck2019contact identified. As we've seen throughout this book, visualizing data before and after analysis helps benchmark and sanity-check our intuitions about the formal statistical results. In a meta-analysis, a common way to do so is the **forest plot**, which depicts individual studies' estimates and confidence intervals.^[You can ignore for now the column of percentages and the final line, "RE Model"; we will return to these later.] In the forest plot in Figure \@ref(fig:meta-forest), the larger squares correspond to more precise studies; notice how much narrower their confidence intervals are than the confidence intervals of less precise studies. In Paluck et al.'s meta-analysis, the mean of the studies' effect size estimates is `r round( mean(DF$d), digits )`. 


```{r meta-forest, fig.cap="Forest plot for Paluck et al. meta-analysis. Studies are ordered from smallest to largest standard error.", fig.height=8}
metafor::forest(re.m,
       showweights = TRUE,
       header = TRUE,
       xlab = "Standardized mean difference")
```

This averaging approach is a step in the right direction, but it has an important limitation. Averaging effect size estimates gives equal weight to each study. A small study [e.g.,  N=`r DF[27, ]$n_total`, @clunies1989changing] contributes as much to the mean effect size as a large study [e.g., N=`r DF[1, ]$n_total`, @boisjoly2006empathy]. Larger studies typically provide more accurate estimates of effect sizes, so this weighting seems problematic. Larger studies should carry more weight in the analysis. 

To address this issue, **fixed-effect meta-analysis** uses a **weighted average** approach. Larger, more precise studies are given more weight in the calculation of the overall effect size. Specifically, studies are weighed by the inverse of their variance (i.e., the inverse of their squared standard error). This makes sense because larger, more precise studies have smaller variances, and thus get more weight in the analysis. 

The fixed-effect pooled estimate is:

$$\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}$$ where $k$ is the number of studies, $\widehat{\theta}_i$ is the point estimate of the $i^{th}$ study, and $w_i = 1/\widehat{\sigma}^2_i$ is study $i$'s weight in the analysis (i.e., the inverse of its variance).[^9]

<!-- In Paluck et al.'s meta-analysis, we would calculate the fixed-effect estimate, $\widehat{\mu}$, as: -->

<!-- <!-- hard-coded from DF$d[1:2] and DF$se_d[1:2] --> -->
<!-- $$\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \frac{\widehat{\theta}_{study1}}{\widehat{\sigma}^2_{study1}} + \frac{\widehat{\theta}_{study2}}{\widehat{\sigma}^2_{study2}} + \cdots}{ \frac{1}{\widehat{\sigma}^2_{study1}} + \frac{1}{\widehat{\sigma}^2_{study2}} + \cdots } = -->
<!-- \frac{ \frac{0.03}{0.08^2} + \frac{0.30}{0.08^2} + \cdots }{ \frac{1}{0.08^2} + \frac{1}{0.08^2} + \cdots }$$ -->

We can use the fixed-effects formula to estimate that the overall effect size in Paluck et al.'s meta-analysis studies is a standardized mean difference of $\widehat{\mu}$ = `r round(as.numeric(fe.m$b), 2)`; 95% confidence interval [`r paste0(round(fe.m$ci.lb, 2), ", ", round(fe.m$ci.ub, 2))`]; $p < .001$. Because Cohen's $d$ is our effect size index, this estimate means that intergroup contact decreased prejudice by `r round(as.numeric(fe.m$b), 2)` standard deviations.


[^9]: If you are curious, the standard error of the fixed-effect $\widehat{\mu}$ is $\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}$. This standard error can be used to construct a confidence interval or $p$-value, just like how we talked about in Chapter \@ref(inference).


### Limitations of fixed-effects meta-analysis

One of the limitations of fixed-effect meta-analysis is that it assumes that the true effect size is, well, *fixed*! In other words, fixed-effect meta-analysis assumes that there is a single effect size that all studies are estimating. This is a bold assumption. For example, imagine that intergroup contact (a) decreases prejudice when the groups succeed at their goal, but (b) *increases* prejudice when the groups fail at their goal.  If we combined one study that showed intergroup contact leading to failure with another study showed intergroup contact leading to success, it would appear that the true effect of intergroup contact is zero. 

In Paluck et al.'s meta-analysis, studies differed in several ways that could lead to different true effects. For example, some studies recruited adult participants while others recruited children. If we assume that intergroup contact works different for adults vs. children, then it is misleading to talk about a single intergroup contact effect. Instead, we would say that the effects of intergroup contact varies across studies: an idea called **heterogeneity**. So it doesn't seem reasonable to assume that all the studies in Paluck et al.'s set are examining the same fixed effect. 

Does this presence of heterogeneity remind you of anything from when we analyzed repeated-measures data in Chapter \@ref(models) on models? Recall that, with repeated-measures data, we had to deal with the possibility of heterogeneity across participants -- and we did so by introducing participant-level random intercepts to our regression model. Turns out that we can do a similar thing in meta-analysis, dealing with heterogeneity across studies!

### Random-effects meta-analysis

While fixed-effect meta-analysis essentially assumes that all studies in the meta-analysis have the same population effect size, $\mu$, random-effects meta-analysis instead postulates that studies' population effects come from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\tau$.[^10] The larger the standard deviation, $\tau$, the more heterogeneous the effects are across studies. A random-effects model then estimates both $\mu$ and $\tau$, for example by maximum likelihood [@dersimonian1986meta; @brockwell2001comparison].[^11]

[^10]: Technically, other specifications of random-effects meta-analysis are possible. For example, robust variance estimation does not require making assumptions about the distribution of effects across studies [@hedges2010robust]. These approaches also have other substantial advantages, like their ability to handle effects that are clustered [e.g., because some papers contribute multiple estimates; @hedges2010robust; @pustejovsky2021meta] and their ability to provide better inference in meta-analyses with relatively few studies [@tipton2015small]. For these reasons, we tend to use these methods by default when conducting meta-analyses.

[^11]: A confidence interval and $p$-value for the random-effects estimate $\widehat{\mu}$ can be obtained using standard theory for maximum likelihood estimates with an additional adjustment that helps account for uncertainty in estimating $\tau$ [@knapp2003improved].


Like fixed-effect meta-analysis, the random-effects estimate of $\widehat{\mu}$ is still a weighted average of studies' effect size estimates: $$\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}$$

However, in random-effects meta-analysis, the inverse-variance weights now incorporate heterogeneity: $w_i = 1/\left(\widehat{\tau}^2 + \widehat{\sigma}^2_i \right)$. Where before we had one factor in our weights, now we have two. These weights represent the inverse of studies' *marginal* variances, taking into account both statistical error due to their finite sample sizes ($\widehat{\sigma}^2_i$) and also genuine effect heterogeneity ($\widehat{\tau}^2$).[^12] 

[^12]: The estimate of $\widehat{\tau}^2$ is a bit more complicated, but is essentially a weighted average of studies' residuals, $\widehat{\theta_i} - \widehat{\mu}$, while subtracting away variation due to statistical error, $\widehat{\sigma}^2_i$ [@dersimonian1986meta; @brockwell2001comparison].


Conducting a random-effects meta-analysis of Paluck et al.'s dataset yields $\widehat{\mu}$ = `r round(as.numeric(re.m$b), 2)` ; 95% confidence interval [ `r paste0(round(re.m$ci.lb, 2), ", ", round(re.m$ci.ub, 2))` ]; $p < .001$. That is, they estimated that, *on average across studies*, intergroup contact was associated with a decrease in prejudice of `r round(as.numeric(re.m$b), 2)` standard deviations. This meta-analytic estimate is shown as the bottom line of Figure \@ref(fig:meta-forest).

However, these effects appeared to differ considerably across studies. Remember that in random-effects meta-analysis, the estimate $\widehat{\mu}$ represents only the *mean* population effect across studies. It tells us nothing about how much the effects *vary* across studies. Thus, we recommend always reporting the heterogeneity estimate $\widehat{\tau}$, perhaps supplemented by other related metrics [@riley2011interpretation; @wang2019simple; @mathur_mam; @npphat]. Reporting the heterogeneity indicates how consistent or inconsistent the effects are across studies, which may point to the need to investigate *moderators* of the effect (i.e., factors that can cause a shift in the size of the effect, such as the type of intergroup contact intervention).[^13] 

[^13]: One common approach to investigating moderators in meta-analysis is meta-regression, in which moderators (e.g., type of intergroup contact) are included as covariates in a random-effects meta-analysis model [@thompson2002should]. As in standard regression, coefficients can then be estimated for each moderator, representing the mean difference in population effect between studies with versus without the moderator.


In Paluck et al.'s meta-analysis, 
; they estimated that the standard deviation of effects across studies was $\widehat{\tau}$ = `r tauStats[1]` ; 95% confidence interval [`r tauStats[2]`, `r tauStats[3]`]. This estimate indicates a substantial amount of heterogeneity! To conveniently visualize these results, we can plot the estimated density of the population effects, which is just a normal distribution with mean $\widehat{\mu}$ and standard deviation $\widehat{\tau}$ (Figure \@ref(fig:meta-densities)).

## Bias in meta-analysis

Meta-analysis is an invaluable tool to synthesize evidence across studies. Using meta-analysis can lead to increased precision of our estimates of experimental effects. But a precise estimate is less useful if it is subject to bias. 

Meta-analyses can be compromised by two categories of bias: **within-study biases** and **across-study biases**. Either type can lead to meta-analysis estimates that are too large, too small, or in the wrong direction. We will now discuss examples of each type of bias as well as ways to address these biases when conducting a meta-analysis, including mitigating the biases at the outset through sound meta-analysis design and also assessing the robustness of the ultimate conclusions to possible remaining bias.

### Within-study biases

Within-study biases -- such as demand characteristics, confounds, and order effects -- not only impact the validity of individual studies, but also any attempt to synthesize those studies. In other words: garbage in, garbage out. For example, @paluck2019contact noted that early studies on intergroup contact almost exclusively used non-randomized designs. Imagine a hypothetical study where researchers (a) are studying a completely ineffective intergroup contact intervention, and (b) non-randomly assign low-prejudice people to the intergroup contact condition and high-prejudice people to the control condition. In a scenario like this, the researcher will, of course, find that the prejudice was lower in the intergroup contact condition. However, this is not a true effect of the contact intervention, but rather a spurious effect of non-random assignment. 

Now imagine repeating this scenario across many studies and then performing a meta-analysis. The meta-analyst would find impressive evidence of an intergroup contact effect, but this is simply driven by systematic non-random assignment. Once again: you put garbage in, you get garbage out.

To mitigate this problem, meta-analysts often exclude studies that may be affected by within-study bias. For example, @paluck2019contact excluded non-randomized studies to avoid concerns about confounding. Preregistration of exclusion criteria for meta-analyses is one way to ensure that these kinds of data-quality controls are applied in a systematic and uniform way, rather than being applied after looking at the results. 

Sometimes, though, particular sources of biased or low-quality data are not known ahead of time. After data have been collected, meta-analysts often also  assess studies' risks of bias qualitatively using established rating tools [@art]. Doing so allows the meta-analyst to communicate just how much within-study bias there may be.^[@paluck2019contact did not use this tool, but they could have used it to communicate for example, the extent to which participants might have differentially dropped out of the study.] Meta-analysts also often conduct sensitivity analyses that examine how much results change when excluding certain types of studies. For example, if nonrandom assignment is a concern, a meta-analysts may run the analyses with and without studies using nonrandom assignment in order to determine if including these studies changes the meta-analysis results. These two options  parallel our discussion of experimental preregistration in Chapter \@ref(prereg): To allay concerns about results-dependent meta-analysis researchers can either preregister their analyses ahead of time or else be transparent about their choices after the fact. Sensitivity analyses can allay concerns that a specific choice of exclusion criteria is critically related to the reported results. 

<!-- It would be nice to show the reader an example of a risk of bias rating scale. Doing so would also help clarify what types of within-study biases meta-analysts are typically concerned about. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q4Fk3HCuBRwIDWTGZa5oH11OdR4Gbhdo/view-->

### Across-study biases

Across-study biases refer to behaviors like researchers selecting reporting certain types of findings (**selective reporting**) or selectively publishing certain types of findings (**publication bias**). Often, these across-study biases favor statistically significant positive results, which means the meta-analysis of the available results will be inflated. For example, if researchers publish only the studies that yield statistically significant positive results and hide the studies that don't, statistically combining the published studies via meta-analysis will obviously lead to exaggerated effect size estimates. Bias in, bias out -- garbage in, garbage out.

::: accident-report
🔬 Accident Report: Quantifying publication bias in the social sciences

In 2014, @franco2014 and colleagues examined the population of 221 studies conducted through a funding initiative called TESS ("time-sharing experiments in the social sciences") that helps researchers run experiments on nationally-representative samples in the U.S. This sample of studies was unique in that everyone that used TESS had to register their study with the group. That meant that Franco et al. knew the whole universe of studies that had been conducted using TESS -- a key piece of information that meta-analysts almost never have available. 

Using this information, Franco and colleagues examined the records of these studies to determine whether the researchers found statistically significant results, a mixture of statistically significant and non-significant results, or only non-significant results. Then, they examined the likelihood that these results were published in the scientific literature.

Which results do you think were most likely to be published? If you guessed "significant results," then you have a good intuition about publication bias. Over 60% of studies with statistically significant results were published, compared to the mere 25% of studies that produced only statistically non-significant results. Everyone believes that there is some degree of publication bias, but this finding was important because it quantified how strong that bias was, at least for one sample of studies. 
:::

Like within-study biases, meta-analysts often try to mitigate across-study biases by being careful about what studies make it into the meta-analysis. Meta-analysts don't only want to capture high-profile, published studies on their effect of interest, but also studies published in low-profile journals and the so-called "gray literature" [i.e., unpublished dissertations and theses; @lefebvre2019searching].[^5]

[^5]: Evidence is mixed regarding whether including gray literature actually reduces across-study biases in meta-analysis [@tsuji2020addressing; @sapbe], but it is still common practice to try to include this literature.

There are also statistical methods to help assess how robust the results may be to across-study biases. Among the most popular tools to assess and correct for publication bias is the **funnel plot** [@duval2000trim; @egger1997bias]. A funnel plot shows the relationship between studies' effect estimates and their precision (usually their standard error). They are called "funnel plots" because usually as the precision gets larger, the effects "funnel" towards the meta-analytic estimate. As the precision is smaller, they spread out more because of greater measurement error.

Here is an example of one type of funnel plot [@sapb] for a simulated meta-analysis of 100 studies with no publication bias:

<!-- MM: I used a type of enhanced funnel here that I believe helps visualize publication bias better than standard funnels. Mike, up to you if you want regular funnels instead. I've included commented code for those as well. I didn't describe the purpose of the grey diamonds for now. Text snippet if we decide to briefly mention that: "the grey diamonds represent worst-case point estimate within only the studies with $p \ge 0.05$ or negative estimates." -->

<!-- NC: I like the funnel plot, but it keeps duplicating the plots for some reason" -->


```{r meta-funnel-unbiased, fig.cap = "Significance funnel plot for a meta-analysis simulated to have no publication bias. Orange points: studies with $p < 0.05$ and positive estimates.

As implied by the "funnel" moniker, our plot looks a little funnel-like. Larger studies (those with smaller standard errors) cluster more closely around the mean of `r round(meta.all$b, digits)` than do smaller studies, but large and small studies alike have point estimates centered around the mean. That is, the funnel plot is symmetric.^[Classic funnel plots look more like Figure \@ref(fig:meta-classic-funnel). Our version is different in a couple of ways. Most prominently, we don't have the vertical axis reversed (which we think is confusing), and we don't have the left boundary highlighted (because we think folks don't typically select for negative studies).]

Not all funnel plots are symmetric! Figure \@ref(fig:meta-funnel-biased) is what happens to our hypothetical meta-analysis if all studies with $p<0.05$ and positive estimates are published, but only 10% of studies with $p \ge 0.05$ or with negative estimates are published. The introduction of publication bias dramatically inflates the pooled estimate from `r round(meta.all$b, digits)` to `r round(meta.p$b, digits)`.[^8] Also, there appears to be a correlation between studies' estimates and their standard errors, such that smaller studies tend to have larger estimates than do larger studies. This correlation is often called **funnel plot asymmetry** because the funnel plot starts to look like a right triangle rather than a funnel. Funnel plot asymmetry *can* be a diagnostic for publication bias, though it isn't always a perfect indicator, as we'll see in the next subsection.

### Across-study bias correction

How do we identify and correct bias across studies? Starting with the funnel plot makes it look like the right thing to do is to quantify how asymmetric it is. Indeed, several popular statistical methods, such as Trim-and-Fill [@duval2000trim] and Egger's regression [@egger1997bias] are designed to quantify funnel plot asymmetry. But funnel plot asymmetry is not always representative of publication bias! 

Sometimes funnel plot asymmetry is driven by genuine differences in the effects being studied in small and large studies [@egger1997bias; @lau2006case]. For example, in a meta-analysis of intervention studies, if the most effective interventions are also the most expensive or difficult to implement, these highly effective interventions might be used primarily in the smallest studies ("small study effects"). Essentially, funnel plots and related methods can detect publication bias in which (1) small studies with large positive point estimates are more likely to be published than small studies with small or negative point estimates; and (2) the largest studies are published regardless of the magnitude of their point estimates. That model of publication bias is sometimes what is happening, but not always!

A more flexible approach for detecting publication bias uses **selection models**. These models can detect other forms of publication bias that funnel plots may not detect, such as publication bias that favors *significant* results. We won't cover these methods in detail here, but we think they are a better approach to the question.^[High-level overviews of selection models are given in @mcshane2016adjusting and @smt. For more methodological detail, see @hedges1984estimation, @iyengar1988, and @vevea1995. For a tutorial on fitting and interpreting selection models, see @smt.] 

You may also have heard of "$p$-methods" to detect across-study biases such as $p$-curve and $p$-uniform [@simonsohn2014p; @simonsohn2014b; @van2015meta]. These methods essentially assess whether the significant $p$-values "bunch up" just under 0.05, which is taken to indicate publication bias. These methods are increasingly popular in psychology and have their merits. However, it is important to note that these methods are actually simplified versions of selection models [e.g., @hedges1984estimation] that work only under considerably more restrictive settings than do the original selection models [for example, when there is not heterogeneity across studies; @mcshane2016adjusting]. For this reason, it is usually (although not always) better to use selection models in place of the more restrictive $p$-methods.

In Paluck and colleagues' meta-analysis, they used a regression-based approach to assess and correct for publication bias. This approach provided significant evidence of a relationship between the standard error and effect size (i.e., an asymmetric funnel plot). This asymmetric funnel plot could be driven by small study effects, but it may be indicative of publication bias. Paluck and colleague subsequently used this same regression-based approach to try to correct for potential publication bias. Unfortunately, results from this model indicated that the bias-corrected effect size estimate was close to zero. In other words, even though all studies estimated that intergroup contact decreased prejudice, it is possible that there are unpublished studies that did not find this (or found that intergroup contact increased prejudice).

⚠️ Garbage in, garbage out? Meta-analyzing bad research 

Botox can help eliminate wrinkles. But some researchers have also suggested that it may help treat clinical depression when used to paralyze the muscles associated with frowning. As crazy as they may sound, a quick examination of the literature would lead many to conclude that this treatment works. Studies that randomly assign depressed patients to either receive Botox injections or saline injections do indeed find that Botox recipients exhibit decreases in depression. And when you combine all available evidence in a meta-analysis, you find that this difference is quite large: $\widehat{d}$ = 0.83, 95% CI [0.52, 1.14]. Unfortunately, this meta-analytic result has problems with both within- and between-study bias [@coles2019does]. 

First, participants are not supposed to know whether they have been randomly assigned to receive Botox or a control saline injections. However, only one of these treatments leads the upper half of your face to be paralyzed! After a couple of weeks you're pretty likely to figure out whether you received the Botox treatment or control saline injection. Thus, the apparent effect of Botox on depression could very well be a placebo effect, a clear within-study bias issue. 

Second,  51% of the outcomes measured were found not to have been reported by the study authors. This finding raises concerns about selective reporting: perhaps researchers examining the effects of Botox on depression only report the outcomes that demonstrate an effect, but not those that do not. In this scenario, any meta-analytic conclusions are potentially undermined by between-study bias.

Garbage in, garbage out: If within- and between-study bias is not properly mitigated, it is difficult to make valid inferences from even the best-conducted meta-analysis.

## Chapter summary: Meta-analysis

Taken together, Paluck and colleagues' use of meta-analysis provided several important insights that would have been easy to miss in a non-quantitative review. First, despite a preponderance of non-significant findings, real-world intergroup contact interventions were estimated to significant decrease prejudice by `r round(as.numeric(re.m$b), 2)` standard deviations.
On the other hand, there was significant heterogeneity in intergroup contact effects, suggesting that there are important moderators of the effectiveness of these interventions. And finally, publication bias was a substantial concern, suggesting the need for follow-up research that will be published regardless of the outcome.

Overall, meta-analysis is a key technique for aggregating evidence across studies. Meta-analysis allows researchers to move beyond the bias of naive techniques like vote counting and towards a more quantitative summary of an experimental effect. Unfortunately, a meta-analysis is only as good as the literature it's based on, so the aspiring meta-analyst must be aware of both within- and between-study biases!

Imagine that you read the following result in the abstract of a meta-analysis: "In 83 randomized studies of middle school children, replacing one hour of class time with mindfulness meditation significantly improved standardized test scores (standardized mean difference $\widehat{\mu} = 0.05$; 95% confidence interval: [$0.01, 0.09$]; $p<0.05$)." Why is this a problematic way to report on meta-analysis results? Suggest a better sentence to replace this one.

As you read the rest of the meta-analysis, you find that the authors conclude that "These findings demonstrate robust benefits of meditation for children, suggesting that test scores improve even when the meditation is introduced as a replacement for normal class time." You recall that the heterogeneity estimate was $\widehat{\tau} = 0.90$. Do you think that this result regarding the heterogeneity tends to support, or rather tends to undermine, the concluding sentence of the meta-analysis? Why?

What kinds of within-study biases would concern you in this meta-analysis? How might you assess the credibility of the meta-analyzed studies and of the meta-analysis as whole in light of these possible biases?
