### Debriefing participants

Every study should have a debriefing to end the study. In general, a debriefing is composed of four parts: (1) participation gratitude, (2) discussion of goals, (3) explanation of deception, and (4) questions and clarification [@allen2017]. 

**Gratitude.** Thank participants for their involvement in research study! Sometimes thanks is enough (for a short experiment), but manby studies also include an additional token of appreciation such as monetary compensation or course credit. If monetary or other physical compensation will be implemented, it should be commensurate with the amount of time and effort required for participation. Compensation structures vary widely from place to place; typically local IRBs will have guidelines that they ask reseachers to comply with.

**Discussion of goals.** Researchers should briefly share the purpose of the research study with participants. Why were participants recruited for this study in the first place? What are the researchers hoping to learn by conducting this study? It is important to ensure that participants fully understand the goals of the study, so avoiding technical jargon or confusing language is critical. You might also consider sharing any preliminary findings or where to find the completed write-up at the study's conclusion -- many engaged participants really appreciate a link to research findings, even months or years after participation.^[Sharing goals is especially important when some aspect of the study appears evaluative -- participants will often be interested in knowing how well they preformed against their peers. For example, a parent whose child completed a word-recognition task may request information about their child's performance. It is often important to highlight that the goals of the study are not about individual evaluation and ranking.] 

**Explanation of deception.** Researchers must reveal any deception during debriefing, regardless of how minor the deception seems to the researcher. This component of the debriefing process can be thought of as "dehoaxing" because it is meant to illuminate any aspects of the study that were previously misleading or inaccurate [@holmes1976]. The goal both to reveal the true intent of the study and to alleviate any potential anxiety associated with the deception. After identifying where the deception occurred, it is useful to explain why the deception was necessary for the study's success. 

**Questions and clarification.** Finally, researchers should answer any questions or address any concerns raised by participants. Many researchers use this opportunity to first ask participants about their interpretation of the study, what they thought were the study goals. This not only illuminates aspects of the study design that may have been unclear to or hidden from participants, but it also begins a discussion where both researchers and participants can communicate about this joint experience. This step is also helpful in identifying negative emotions or feelings resulting from the study [@allen2017]. When participants do express negative emotions, researchers are responsible for sharing resources participants can use to work though the discomfort. 

With the widespread use of data collection sites such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific, many researchers have elected to conduct some or all of their studies online. Debriefing is required regardless of the study's presentation method. When a study is fully automated and participants do not interact with experimenters, researchers can make use of **debriefing statements**. Debriefing statements are documents that summarize all four components of the debriefing process (participation gratitude, discussion of goals, explanation of deception, and questions and clarification). Because experimenters are not present at the end of the study to answer participant questions, the statement typically provides the contact information for both the principal investigator and the IRB office. These communication channels should be clearly conveyed should participants need to follow up about the study for any reason.^[Some studies may not be ethically appropriate for being run online. Studies that have substantial deception or that induce negative emotions may require an experimenter present to alleviate concerns and address points of deception rather than relying on a written statement.]

### Special considerations for vulnerable populations

Regardless of who is participating in research, investigators have an obligation to protect the rights and well-being of all participants. However, some populations have been should be considered **vulnerable** because of their decreased agency -- either in general or in the face of potentially coercive situations. These populations should receive additional considerations or oversight when involving them in research studies. In this section, we will consider a few common vulnerable populations and discuss whether and how to include them in research studies.

**People with disabilities.** There are thousands of disabilities that affect cognition, development, motor ability, communication, and decision-making with varying degrees of interference, so it is first important to remember that considerations for this population will be just as diverse as its members. Officially, a disability is a diagnosed mental or physical condition that limits or restricts a person's involvement in daily activities [@stineman2001]. Roughly 8% of the US population is disabled, which makes it likely that, in the context of a research study, researchers may come into contact with someone who is disabled. Assuming all general rules and regulations are followed, there are no laws that preclude people with disabilities from participating in research. However, those with cognitive disabilities who are unable to make their own decisions (importantly, this also applies to children with or without disabilities) may only participant with written consent from a legal guardian and with their individual assent (if applicable). This means that even if the person provides assent, researchers may not enroll them in the research study without also obtaining consent from their guardian. Those retaining full cognitive capacity but who have other disabilities that make it challenging to participate normally in the research study should receive appropriate accommodations to access the material, including the study's risks and benefits.

(TITLE) The Tuskeegee Syphilis Study 

In 1929, The United States Public Health Service (USPHS) was perplexed by the effects of a particular disease with an epicenter in Macon County, Alabama, with an overwhelmingly Black population [@brandt1978]. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection that can either be in a visible and active stage or in a latent stage. At the time of the study's inception, roughly 36% of Tuskegee's adult population had developed some form of syphilis, one of the highest infection rates in America [@white2006]. 

USPHS recruited 400 Black males from 25--60 years of age with latent syphilis and 200 Black males without the infection to serve as a control group to participate in what would become one of the most exploitative research studies ever done on American soil [@brandt1978]. The USPHS sought the help of the Macon County Board of Health to recruit participants with the promise that they would provide treatment for community members with syphilis. The researchers sought poor, illiterate Blacks and, instead of telling them that they were being recruited for a research study, they merely informed them that they would be treated for "bad blood", a phrase used in that time to refer to syphilis. 

Because the study was only interested in tracking the natural course of latent syphilis without any medical intervention, the USPHS had no intention of providing any care to its participants. To assuage participants, the USPHS distributed an ointment not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis, and only small doses of a medication actually used to treat the infection. In addition, participants underwent a spinal tap which was presented to them as another form of therapy and their "last chance for free treatment." By 1955, just over 30% of the original participants had died from syphilis complications. 

It took until the 1970s before the final report was released and (the lack of) treatment ended. In total, 128 participants died of syphilis or complications from the infection, 40 wives became infected, and 19 children were born with the infection [@katz2011]. The damage rippled through two generations, and many never actually learned what had been done to them. The Tuskeegee experiment violates nearly every single guideline for research described above -- indeed in its many horrifying violations of research participants' agency, it provides a blueprint for future regulation to prevent any aspect of it from being repeated. 

Investigators did not obtain informed consent. Participants were not made aware of all known risks and benefits involved with their participation. Instead, they were deceived by researchers who led them to believe that diagnostic and invasive exams were directly related to their treatment.^[In human subjects research, **deception** is a specific technical term that refers to cases when (1) experimenters withold any information about its goals or intentions, (2) experimenters hide their true identity (such as when using a confederate), (3) some aspects of the research are under- or overstated to conceal certain information, or (4) participants receive any false or misleading information [@tai2011].]

Participants were denied appropriate treatment following the discovery that penicillin was effective at treating syphilis [@mahoney1943]. The USPHS requested that medical professionals overseeing their care outside of the research study not offer treatment to participants so as to perserve the study's integrity. This intervention violated participants' rights to equal access to care, which should have taken precedence over the results of the study. 

Finally, recruitment was both imbalanced and coercive. Not only were participants selected from the poorest of neighborhoods in the hopes of finding vulnerable populations with little agency, but they were also bribed with empty promises of treatment and a monetary incentive (payment for burial fees, a financial obstacle for many sharecroppers and tenant farmers at the time).
