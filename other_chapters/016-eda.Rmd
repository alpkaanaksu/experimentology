* Explain how to evaluate the sensitivity of main analyses to modeling assumptions.
* Describe how modeling and data visualization support data analysis.
* Compare individual and item differences.

::: {.box .case_study}
Frank, Vul, & Johnson (2009) report a small subset of the many many analyses they ran on a very rich dataset. Luckily, the simplest analysis was the most important, and that one was replicable (Frank, Amso, and Johnson 2014).

## Data exploration

General idea of "poking around" to find patterns in data that can inspire new ideas or perspectives on an experiment.

- Exploratory visualization

- Dimensionality reduction: exploratory factor analysis and PCA (when these techniques are useful, and roughly what they do; no mathematical exploration). Contrast with the use of these techniques in measurement and measure development. 

- Exploiting variation: individual differences and item differences. (Some discussion of psychometric models like item response theory as a way of exploring this variation).

## Exploratory modeling and theory-building
