::: {.box .learning_goals}
* Write clearly by being concise, structure, etc…
* Write reproducibly by interleaving writing and analysis code
* Write responsibly by acknowledging limitations, correct errors…
:::</p>
<p>Its not your responsibility to never make a mistake. That would be an unrealistic expectation. However, it <strong>is</strong> your responsibility to minimize the likelihood of errors (by working reproducibily), help other scientists evaluate your research (by working transparently), and declare/correct errors when they are identified (by working responsibly).</p>
<p>[in the old days, you’d write a letter to a few fellow scientists or stand in front of them doing a live demonstration of your experiment]</p>
<div id="writing-clearly" class="section level2" number="18.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.1</span> Writing clearly</h2>
<p>All of the effort you put into running an effective experiment will be wasted if you cannot clearly communicate what you did and what you found to other scientists. Writing is powerful. Its a conversation that you will only have once, but hundreds of readers with collectively have with you. Only say what is relevant, say it as clearly as possible.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of writing? “Telepathy, of course.” - Stephen King (2000) On Writing. We need to transfer information to the reader in the most efficient and clear way possible. How can we do this? There are no hard and fast rules of good writing. Here we will share a few of our own ideas and highlight some key conventions of scientific writing.</p>
<p>There are no strict rules of good writing, but there are conventions (as expected by academic journals) and advice (which we can offer from our experience). Writing is an art form - though scientific writing usually has to follow certain conventions, it doesn’t necessarily have to be dry. There are ways to surprise and excite your reader with the use of metaphor or even humour. There’s enjoyment to be found in expressing complex topics in a an elegant fashion.</p>
<p>Just as we want computer software to be user-friendly, we want our written documents to be reader-friendly.</p>
<p>Learn to write by writing. As much as we’re enjoying chatting to you in this chapter, reading how to write is nowhere near as effective as getting stuck in and writing. For most of us, clear writing does not come naturally. You will need to work at, continuously writing, reading, and rewriting. With experience, you’re writing will improve, but its unlikely you’ll get a sentence right first time. You’re unlikely to become an expert writer overnight. It takes practice. Don’t be paralysed by perfectionism. At some point its time to send the manuscript to your collaborators.</p>
<div id="clarity" class="section level3" number="18.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">18.1.1</span> Clarity</h3>
<p>Be explicit — the reader should not have to guess what you mean
Be concrete — ideas are often easier to grasp when you provide examples</p>
<p>Maximise the signal to noise ratio: remove irrelevant clutter and distractions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-doumont2009" role="doc-biblioref">Doumont, 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Be consistent - it reduces cognitive load.</p>
<p>Why say “at this point in time” rather than “now”?</p>
<p>garden metaphor - you’re first draft is like a unruly garden vegetation, you’ve got to prune and sculpt your writing. And its no good having a few beautiful plants, your garden needs a layout to guide the reader where you want them.</p>
<p>Be direct and explicit. If you have genuine uncertainty about something, say so explicitly, don’t hide that it in vague writing.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure---hourglass-and-peel" class="section level3" number="18.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">18.1.2</span> Structure - hourglass and PEEL</h3>
<p>Detective narrative (set the scene, describe the mystery (‘the knowledge gap’), describe the investigation, results section - the big reveal!, discussion - the detective reminds us how they got to this point and ties up the loose ends, maybe even leaves a trailer about the next mystery…)</p>
<p>One sentence, one idea.</p>
<p>What is the problem you are trying to solve and how does your study address it? The problem statement should be specific rather than broad. For example, “We do not understand how memory works” is too broad.</p>
<p>Sometimes your writing is not clear because your thinking is not clear. First ask yourself - what do I want to say? If you are not sure, then you must take the time to improve your understanding (consult a textbook or speak to your advisor) and resist the temptation to hide your lack of clarify in obscure writing. In fact, the process of writing often reveals weaknesses in intellectual understanding or argumentation. After you know what you want to say, you can read your writing and ask yourself - have I said it? You would not write a shopping list before first deciding what you are going to cook.</p>
<p>Academic standards: IMRaD and hourglass structure. Standard APA format and the “random access” document (folks don’t necessarily read papers linearly or in their entirety) [sidebar note on IMRaD - some journals put methods at the end or combine results and discussion]. [historical sidebar - before IMRaD things were a bit more chaotic and scientific claims were often made via letters - inc. example letter quotes of a famous discovery?]. Early usage of IMRaD took off in the 1800s and emerged as the dominant approach in the mid 1900s as scientific productivity rapidly expanded in the post-war era. IMRaD is more efficient because readers know what to expect. It improves efficiency because readers can jump to relevant sections without having to read the entire paper. Its clearer because it follows a narrative logic - what’s the problem? (introduction), how did you address it (methods), what did you find (results), what does it mean and where do we go from here? (discussion)</p>
<p>Articles have a hierarchical structure - sections, paragraphs, sentences, words.</p>
<p>Discussion - don’t feel the need to argue for a particular position / interpretation. It is a discussion section, not a debate section. It is not your job to convince your reader of a particular interpretation, it is your job to discuss the relative merits of different relevant interpretations. Similarly, you should be open about the limitations of your study - a limitation is a not necessarily a failing, they are inevitable - all studies are limited.</p>
<p>Paragraphs and topic sentences. Start and end paragraphs like a relay race where the baton is passed between paragraphs.</p>
<p>Be concise. “Omit needless words.” - William Strunk. For example, <em>in the event that</em> vs. <em>if</em>. Or <em>we performed an investigation of</em> vs. <em>we investigated</em>. Your first draft will rarely be as concise as possible. Each time you read through, omit needless words.</p>
<p>Use active voice rather than passive voice. For example, say “We analyzed the data” rather than “The data were analysed” or, worse, “An analysis of the data was carried out”. The first passive voice example is ambiguous (who were the data analysed by?) and the second is ambiguous and long-winded. The active voice is clear about the agent (the authors analyzed the data) and is concise. Historically, scientific articles tended to be written passive voice because it (allegedly) conveyed a aura of objectivity. However, this is illusory, and active voice is usually clearer and more concise. Another example: “It is believed that…” vs. “We believe that…” or “Scientists believe that…”</p>
<p>Know who you’re writing for. Consider the audience you are writing for and calibrate your writing accordingly</p>
<p>Always think about the reader while you write. You cannot assume they have the same knowledge as you, you need to guide them.</p>
<p>Define technical terminology then use it consistently - for example, replication and reproducibility may sound similar, but they have important technical definitions, so do not use them interchangeably. And be clear about the definition you are going to be using.</p>
<p>Use abbreviations sparing - they create unnecessary cognitive load if the reader has to keep track of lots of them (an exception might be definitions that are very common in your field e.g., fMRI, but you should at least define them and always consider your audience - if you think your work may appeal to readers who do not know the abbreviation then avoid using it)</p>
<p>Scientific writing does not have to be dull and boring - the best scientist writers find a way to create a style that is both professional and elegant - sometimes even funny!</p>
<p>Ensure that when you make empirical claims you back them up with evidence.</p>
<p>Your goal is not to convey everything you know about a topic, but rather to clearly communicate a limited set of specific messages. Decide what those messages are and focus only on them. For example, in the introduction</p>
<p>Use examples - sometimes your attempts to convey concepts to the reader may fail and leave them adrift, a concrete example gives the reader something to hold on to.</p>
<p>Use figures and diagrams - for example, to describe a series of particant exclusions, use a flow diagram. If the journal limits the number of figures you can use, make use of the supplementary materials.</p>
<p>It may be useful to add sub-sections to, for example sections of the results that refer back to each hypothesis. Number sections.</p>
<p>Use cross-referencing - identify hypotheses with letters (A, B, C) etc or numbers; refer to sections; refer to supplementary materials; refer to tables, figures, etc.</p>
<p>A paragraph is a meaningful chunk of information.</p>
<p>Paragraph structure - PEEL - Point Explain Evidence Link. Make your point, explain further / expand on your point, provide evidence, link back to your orginal point and to the next paragraph.</p>
<p>One idea to try - build up your article layer by layer - start with the sections, then add the signpost sentences of each paragraph, then add the sentences in those paragraphs.</p>
<p>Research articles have some special sections that may break from the typical paragraphing structure - for example, the abstract is one big paragraph that consists of several messages (perhaps better to think of the abstract as several mini paragraphs chained together) and the procedure section may be better as numeric bullet points (to indicate the sequential order in which methodological tasks were performed). You can structure your abstract like a mini-paper (using imrad). Some journals even expect you to delineate these with sub-headings - this is a hadny tool for writing an abstract - pick out the key info from each section of your paper.</p>
<p>We hope these tips are useful, but also note that it can be hard to learn good writing by trying to learn and follow a set of explicit instructions. A more natural way to improve your writing is to read examples of good writing. Just as you learned to talk about imitating the speech of your parents and teachers</p>
<p>How to find these? When a piece of writing strikes you as particularly clear, read more work by the same person. Practice writing regularly yourself. Additionally, try to get honest feedback on your writing from friends or colleagues. Most of us pick up bad habits; improving your writing is an ongoing process - you do not need to learn to write well before writing - just dive in! Over time, you will improve, but its likely you’ll pick up bad habits as well as good ones (we sure have), and you’ll need your colleagues feedback to weed those out.</p>
<p>[historical side note - clarity of communication was one of the foundational principles of modern science. Alchemists had a habit of deliberately obscuring their work - sometimes even writing in cryptic codes. Francis Bacon and Robert Boyle pushed for transparency and clarity. Notoriously, Issac Newton (an alchemist turned scientist), continued to deliberately write in an obscure fashion in order to ‘protect’ his work. See Stephen Heard book chapter 1.]</p>
<p>Rewrite. You’ll be amazed how often you find words you can omit, terms you can make more precise, or elaborate sentence structures you can simplify.</p>

<div id="writing-reproducibly" class="section level2" number="18.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.2</span> Writing reproducibly</h2>
<p>Why write a reproducible manuscript?</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize human error</li>
<li>Makes provenance tracking easier (reconstructing how specific figures/tables were generated)</li>
<li>Makes formatting changes easier (e.g., MLA to APA; different journal formats)</li>
<li>Enables other researchers to run the same analyses with new data</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing a reproducible manuscript allows researchers to generate results and figures via direct computation rather than having to manually copy them into the manuscript.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Literate programming (Knuth 1992): Instead of supporting code with documentation (e.g., code), reverse the emphasis by supporting documentation (e.g., your manuscript) with code (e.g., using R Markdown)</p></li>
<li><p>Reproducible data analysis: anyone else should be able to run your script and obtain identical results</p>
<ul>
<li>Defensive coding: assume errors are inevitable, include assert statements and sanity checks, catch incorrect inputs (Stodden et al. 2016)</li>
<li>Use free/open-source software when possible</li>
<li>Use version control (see Chapter 12 for conceptual overview, Appendix B for tutorial)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Preserving the computational environment (e.g., Code Ocean), preserve package versions (e.g., renv for R, pip freeze for Python)</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>show your work. Back in school, we all learned that getting the right answer is not enough, you need to demonstrate how you arrived at that answer in order to get full marks. The same expectation applies to research reports. Don’t just tell the reader what you found, tell them how. That means providing all methodological details. Reporting guidelines can be a useful reminder of what’s relevant and you can also refer back to your preregistration - its easy to forget the details. Advice on using supplementary materials - ok to use liberally, just do not use it to hide important info and don’t let it be dumping ground, it should still be clear and concise. When describing the methods, try to convey the participants experience as clearly as possible - you could even provide a video (Lisa article?)</p></li>
<li><p>cite responsibility. Science is a community cite others when building on their work. Read before you cite. The meaning of a citation is often implicit in the context - but make sure it is clear why your are citing e.g., is it empirical evidence to support a claim? A review of evidence? An idea or theory? A method? A counterargument? There are examples in Gernsbacher’s article of citation misuse. Avoid selective citation. Evaluate and integrate evidence rather than simply listing studies that appear to support your argument. Remember every study has limitations.</p></li>
<li><p>title. you want your title to attract readers, but don’t oversell. If possible, include the research design in the title (e.g., “A cross-sectional study of X”)</p></li>
<li><p>open practices statement</p></li>

</ul>
<p>journal constraints may undermine your efforts to provide comprehensive methods details etc, but usually they are fine with your linking to supplementary information on OSF. That does not exclude leaving out important information from the main report. Many readers won’t dig into the supplement so its your responsibility to make sure they are properly informed. If you feel journal constraints are undermining your ability to be transparent about your research, you should go to a different journal. (e.g., RSOS, Collabra Psychology)</p>

Writing is powerful. Its a conversation that you will only have once, but hundreds of readers with collectively have with you. Only say what is relevant, say it as clearly as possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What is the purpose of writing? “Telepathy, of course.” - Stephen King (2000) On Writing. We need to transfer information to the reader in the most efficient and clear way possible. How can we do this? There are no hard and fast rules of good writing. Here we will share a few of our own ideas and highlight some key conventions of scientific writing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are no strict rules of good writing, but there are conventions (as expected by academic journals) and advice (which we can offer from our experience). Writing is an art form - though scientific writing usually has to follow certain conventions, it doesn’t necessarily have to be dry. There are ways to surprise and excite your reader with the use of metaphor or even humour. There’s enjoyment to be found in expressing complex topics in a an elegant fashion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Just as we want computer software to be user-friendly, we want our written documents to be reader-friendly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Learn to write by writing. As much as we’re enjoying chatting to you in this chapter, reading how to write is nowhere near as effective as getting stuck in and writing. For most of us, clear writing does not come naturally. You will need to work at, continuously writing, reading, and rewriting. With experience, you’re writing will improve, but its unlikely you’ll get a sentence right first time. You’re unlikely to become an expert writer overnight. It takes practice. Don’t be paralysed by perfectionism.

The problem statement should be specific rather than broad. For example, “We do not understand how memory works” is too broad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sometimes your writing is not clear because your thinking is not clear. First ask yourself - what do I want to say? If you are not sure, then you must take the time to improve your understanding (consult a textbook or speak to your advisor) and resist the temptation to hide your lack of clarify in obscure writing. In fact, the process of writing often reveals weaknesses in intellectual understanding or argumentation. After you know what you want to say, you can read your writing and ask yourself - have I said it? You would not write a shopping list before first deciding what you are going to cook.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Academic standards: IMRaD and hourglass structure. Standard APA format and the “random access” document (folks don’t necessarily read papers linearly or in their entirety) [sidebar note on IMRaD - some journals put methods at the end or combine results and discussion]. [historical sidebar - before IMRaD things were a bit more chaotic and scientific claims were often made via letters - inc. example letter quotes of a famous discovery?]. Early usage of IMRaD took off in the 1800s and emerged as the dominant approach in the mid 1900s as scientific productivity rapidly expanded in the post-war era. IMRaD is more efficient because readers know what to expect. It improves efficiency because readers can jump to relevant sections without having to read the entire paper. Its clearer because it follows a narrative logic - what’s the problem? (introduction), how did you address it (methods), what did you find (results), what does it mean and where do we go from here? (discussion)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Articles have a hierarchical structure - sections, paragraphs, sentences, words.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Discussion - don’t feel the need to argue for a particular position / interpretation. It is a discussion section, not a debate section. It is not your job to convince your reader of a particular interpretation, it is your job to discuss the relative merits of different relevant interpretations. Similarly, you should be open about the limitations of your study - a limitation is a not necessarily a failing, they are inevitable - all studies are limited.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Paragraphs and topic sentences. Start and end paragraphs like a relay race where the baton is passed between paragraphs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Be concise. “Omit needless words.” - William Strunk. For example, \u003cem>in the event that\u003c/em> vs. \u003cem>if\u003c/em>. Or \u003cem>we performed an investigation of\u003c/em> vs. \u003cem>we investigated\u003c/em>. Your first draft will rarely be as concise as possible. Each time you read through, omit needless words.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Use active voice rather than passive voice. For example, say “We analyzed the data” rather than “The data were analysed” or, worse, “An analysis of the data was carried out”. The first passive voice example is ambiguous (who were the data analysed by?) and the second is ambiguous and long-winded. The active voice is clear about the agent (the authors analyzed the data) and is concise. Historically, scientific articles tended to be written passive voice because it (allegedly) conveyed a aura of objectivity. However, this is illusory, and active voice is usually clearer and more concise. Another example: “It is believed that…” vs. “We believe that…” or “Scientists believe that…”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Know who you’re writing for. Consider the audience you are writing for and calibrate your writing accordingly\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Always think about the reader while you write. You cannot assume they have the same knowledge as you, you need to guide them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Define technical terminology then use it consistently - for example, replication and reproducibility may sound similar, but they have important technical definitions, so do not use them interchangeably. And be clear about the definition you are going to be using.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Use abbreviations sparing - they create unnecessary cognitive load if the reader has to keep track of lots of them (an exception might be definitions that are very common in your field e.g., fMRI, but you should at least define them and always consider your audience - if you think your work may appeal to readers who do not know the abbreviation then avoid using it)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Scientific writing does not have to be dull and boring - the best scientist writers find a way to create a style that is both professional and elegant - sometimes even funny!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ensure that when you make empirical claims you back them up with evidence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Your goal is not to convey everything you know about a topic, but rather to clearly communicate a limited set of specific messages. Decide what those messages are and focus only on them. For example, in the introduction\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Use examples - sometimes your attempts to convey concepts to the reader may fail and leave them adrift, a concrete example gives the reader something to hold on to.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Use figures and diagrams - for example, to describe a series of particant exclusions, use a flow diagram. If the journal limits the number of figures you can use, make use of the supplementary materials.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It may be useful to add sub-sections to, for example sections of the results that refer back to each hypothesis. Number sections.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Use cross-referencing - identify hypotheses with letters (A, B, C) etc or numbers; refer to sections; refer to supplementary materials; refer to tables, figures, etc.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A paragraph is a meaningful chunk of information.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Paragraph structure - PEEL - Point Explain Evidence Link. Make your point, explain further / expand on your point, provide evidence, link back to your orginal point and to the next paragraph.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One idea to try - build up your article layer by layer - start with the sections, then add the signpost sentences of each paragraph, then add the sentences in those paragraphs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Research articles have some special sections that may break from the typical paragraphing structure - for example, the abstract is one big paragraph that consists of several messages (perhaps better to think of the abstract as several mini paragraphs chained together) and the procedure section may be better as numeric bullet points (to indicate the sequential order in which methodological tasks were performed). You can structure your abstract like a mini-paper (using imrad). Some journals even expect you to delineate these with sub-headings - this is a hadny tool for writing an abstract - pick out the key info from each section of your paper.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We hope these tips are useful, but also note that it can be hard to learn good writing by trying to learn and follow a set of explicit instructions. A more natural way to improve your writing is to read examples of good writing. Just as you learned to talk about imitating the speech of your parents and teachers\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How to find these? When a piece of writing strikes you as particularly clear, read more work by the same person. Practice writing regularly yourself. Additionally, try to get honest feedback on your writing from friends or colleagues. Most of us pick up bad habits; improving your writing is an ongoing process - you do not need to learn to write well before writing - just dive in! Over time, you will improve, but its likely you’ll pick up bad habits as well as good ones (we sure have), and you’ll need your colleagues feedback to weed those out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[historical side note - clarity of communication was one of the foundational principles of modern science. Alchemists had a habit of deliberately obscuring their work - sometimes even writing in cryptic codes. Francis Bacon and Robert Boyle pushed for transparency and clarity. Notoriously, Issac Newton (an alchemist turned scientist), continued to deliberately write in an obscure fashion in order to ‘protect’ his work.

The same expectation applies to research reports. Don’t just tell the reader what you found, tell them how. That means providing all methodological details. Reporting guidelines can be a useful reminder of what’s relevant and you can also refer back to your preregistration - its easy to forget the details. Advice on using supplementary materials - ok to use liberally, just do not use it to hide important info and don’t let it be dumping ground, it should still be clear and concise.
