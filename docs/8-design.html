<li>Define randomization and counterbalancing strategies for removing confounds</li>
<li>Discuss strategies to design experiments that are appropriate to the populations of interest</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The key thesis of our book is that experiments should be designed to yield precise and unbiased measurements of a causal effect. But the causal effect of what? The manipulation, in a word. In an experiment we intervene on the world and measure the effects of that manipulation. We then compare that measurement to a case where the intervention has not occurred. The previous chapter covered the topic of measurement; here we discuss manipulations.</p>
<p>We refer to different intervention states as <strong>conditions</strong> of the experiment. These conditions instantiate specific <strong>factors</strong> of interest. The most common experimental design is the comparison between a <strong>control</strong> condition, in which the intervention is not performed, and an <strong>experimental</strong> (or sometimes, <strong>treatment</strong>) condition in which the intervention is performed. But many other experimental designs are possible. The goal of this chapter is to introduce some of these and give you some tools for considering their tradeoffs. In the first part of the chapter, we‚Äôll introduce some common experimental designs and the vocabulary for describing them.</p>
<p>To be useful, a measure must be a valid measure of a construct of interest. The same is true for a manipulation ‚Äì it must validly relate to the causal effect of interest. In the next part of the chapter, we‚Äôll discuss issues of <strong>manipulation validity</strong>, including both issues of ecological validity and <strong>confounding</strong>. We‚Äôll talk about how practices like <strong>randomization</strong> and <strong>counterbalancing</strong> can help remove nuisance confounds.<label for="tufte-sn-108" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">108</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-108" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">108</span> This section will draw on our introduction of causal inference in Chapter <a href="1-intro.html#intro">1</a>, so if you haven‚Äôt read that, now‚Äôs the time.</span></p>
<p>We‚Äôll end the chapter by discussing some aspects of strategy in experimental design. How do you design an experiment to test a theory? What sorts of experimental designs are maximally efficient?</p>
<div id="experimental-designs" class="section level2" number="8.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Experimental designs</h2>
<p>Experimental designs are so fundamental to so many fields that they are discussed in many different ways. As a result, the terminology can get quite confusing. Here we‚Äôll try to stay consistent by describing an experiment as a relationship between some <strong>manipulation</strong> in which participants are randomly assigned to an experimental condition to evaluate its effects on some <strong>measure</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-109" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">109</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-109" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">109</span> The alternative terminology used in psychology is that of an <strong>independent variable</strong> (the manipulation, which is causally prior and hence ‚Äúindependent‚Äù of other causal influences) and a <strong>dependent variable</strong> (the measure, which causally depends on the manipulation, or so we hypothesize). This terminology seems transparently terrible.</span> An alternative is the terms that are often used in econometrics: the <strong>treatment</strong> (manipulation) and the <strong>outcome</strong> (measure).<label for="tufte-sn-110" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">110</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-110" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">110</span> This terminology has some fairly medical connotations ‚Äì it sounds like the treatment is something substantial and lasting, and the outcome is meaningful. That‚Äôs not always the case in experiments that investigate psychological mechanisms. For example, in a cognitive psychology context, it sounds a bit weird to us to say that the ‚Äútreatment‚Äù was reading scrambled words and the ‚Äúoutcome‚Äù was lexical decision reaction times.</span> We‚Äôll sometimes use ‚Äútreatment‚Äù language here as well.</p>
<p>In this section, we‚Äôll discuss a number of dimensions on which experiments vary. First, they vary in how many factors they incorporate and how these factors are crossed ‚Äì we begin with the two-factor experiment and then discuss generalizations. Second, they vary in how many conditions and how many measures are given to each participant. Third, their manipulations can be discrete or continuous.</p>
<div id="a-two-factor-experiment" class="section level3" number="8.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.1</span> A two-factor experiment</h3>
<p>The classical ‚Äúdesign of experiments‚Äù framework has as its goal to separate observed variability in the dependent measure into 1) variability due to the manipulation(s) and (2) other variability, including measurement error and participant-level variation. This framework maps nicely onto the statistical framework described in Chapters <a href="4-estimation.html#estimation">4</a> ‚Äì <a href="6-models.html#models">6</a>. We are modeling the distribution of our measure using information about the condition structure of our experiment as our predictors.</p>
<p>Different experimental designs will allow us to estimate condition effects more and less effectively. Recall in Chapter <a href="4-estimation.html#estimation">4</a>, we estimated the effect of our manipulation by a simple subtraction: <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = \theta_{treatment} - \theta_{control}\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is the effect estimate, and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>s indicate the estimates for each condition). This logic works just fine also if there are two distinct treatments in a three condition experiment: each treatment can be compared to control separately. For treatment 1, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{T_1} = \theta_{T_2} - \theta_{control}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{T_1} = \theta_{T_2} - \theta_{control}\)</span>.</p>
<p>That logic is going to get more complicated if we have more than one distinct factor of interest, though. Let‚Äôs look at a simple example. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-young2007" role="doc-biblioref">Young et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-young2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> were interested in how moral judgments depend on both the beliefs of actors and the outcomes of their actions. They presented participants with vignettes in which they learned, for example, that Grace visits a chemical factory with her friend and goes to the coffee break room where she sees a white powder that she puts in her friend‚Äôs coffee. They then manipulated both Grace‚Äôs beliefs and the outcomes of her actions following the schema in Figure <a href="8-design.html#fig:design-young-design">8.1</a>. Participants (N=10) used a four-point Likert scale to rate whether the actions were morally forbidden (1) or permissible (4).</p>

</p>
<p>Young et al.‚Äôs design has two factors ‚Äì belief and outcome ‚Äì each with two levels (negative and neutral).<label for="tufte-sn-111" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">111</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-111" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">111</span> Note that neither of these is necessarily a ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù condition: the goal is simply to compare these two levels of the factor ‚Äì negative and neutral ‚Äì to estimate the effect due to the factor.</span> These factors are <strong>fully crossed</strong>: each level of each factor is combined with each level of each other. That means that we can estimate a number of effects of interest. The experimental data are shown in Figure <a href="8-design.html#fig:design-young-data">8.2</a>.</p>

<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p>This fully-crossed design makes it easy for us to estimate quantities of interest. Let‚Äôs say that our <strong>reference</strong> group (equivalent to the control group for now) is neutral belief, neutral outcome, which we‚Äôll notate <span class="math inline">\(B,O\)</span>. Now it‚Äôs easy to use the same kind of subtraction we did before to estimate a variety of effects. For example, we can look at the effect of negative belief in the case of a neutral outcome: <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{-B,O} = \theta_{-B,O} - \theta_{B,O}\)</span>. The effect of a negative outcome is computed similarly as <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{B,-O} = \theta_{B,-O} - \theta_{B,O}\)</span>.</p>
<p>But now there is a complexity: these two <strong>simple effects</strong> (effects of one variable at a particular level of another variable) make a prediction. They predict that the combined effect <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{-B,-O}\)</span> should be equal to the sum of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{-B,O}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{B,-O}\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-112" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">112</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-112" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">112</span> If you‚Äôre interested, you can also compute the <strong>average</strong> or <strong>main</strong> effect of a particular factor via the same subtractive logic. For example, the average effect of negative belief (<span class="math inline">\(-B\)</span>) vs.¬†a neutral belief (<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>) can be computed as <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{-B} = \frac{(\theta_{-O, -B} + \theta_{O, -B}) - (\theta_{-O, B} + \theta_{O, B})}{2}\)</span>.</span> As we can see from the graph, that‚Äôs not right: if it were, the negative belief, negative outcome condition would be below the minimum possible rating. Instead, we observe an <strong>interaction</strong> effect (sometimes called a <strong>two-way interaction</strong> when there are two factors): The effect when both factors are present is different than the sum of the two simple effects.<label for="tufte-sn-113" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">113</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-113" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">113</span> If you‚Äôre reading carefully, you might be thinking that this all sounds like we‚Äôre talking about the analysis of variance (ANOVA), not about experimental design per se. But these two topics are actually the same topic under the hood: the question is how to design an experiment so that these statistical models can be used to estimate particular effects ‚Äì and combinations of effects ‚Äì that we care about.</span> Critically, without a fully-crossed design, we can‚Äôt estimate this interaction and we would have made an incorrect prediction.</p>
</div>
<div id="generalized-factorial-designs" class="section level3" number="8.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.2</span> Generalized factorial designs</h3>
<p>We can refer to Young et al.‚Äôs design, in which there are two factors with two levels each as a <strong>2x2 design</strong> (pronounced ‚Äútwo by two‚Äù). 2x2 designs are incredibly common and useful, but they are only one of an infinite variety of such designs that can be constructed.</p>
<p>Say we added a third factor to Young et al.‚Äôs design such that Grace either feels neutral towards her friend or is angry on that day. If we fully crossed this third affective factor with the other two (belief and outcome), we‚Äôd have a 2x2x2 design. This design would have eight conditions: <span class="math inline">\((A, B, O)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((A, B, -O)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((A, -B, O)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((-A, B, O)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((A, -B, -O)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((-A, B, -O)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((-A, -B, O)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((-A, -B, -O)\)</span>. These conditions would in turn allow us to estimate both two-way and three-way interactions, enumerated in Table <a href="8-design.html#tab:design-three-way">8.1</a>.</p>

<p>Three-way interactions are hard to think about! The affect X belief X outcome interaction tells you about the difference in permissability that‚Äôs due to all three factors being present as opposed to what you‚Äôd predict on the basis of your estimates of the two-way interactions.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.4</span> Discrete and continuous experimental manipulations</h3>
<p>Most experimental designs in most subfields of psychology use discrete condition manipulations: treatment vs.¬†control. In our view, this decision is often a lost opportunity. In our framework, the goal of an experiment is to estimate a causal effect; ideally, this estimate can be generalized to other contexts and used as a basis for theory. Measuring not just one effect but instead a <strong>dose-response</strong> relationship ‚Äì how the measure changes as the strength of the manipulation is changed ‚Äì has a number of benefits in helping to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Many manipulations can be <strong>titrated</strong> ‚Äì that is, their strength can be varied continuously ‚Äì with a little creativity on the part of an experimenter. A curriculum intervention can be applied at different levels of intensity, perhaps by changing the number of sessions in which it is taught. For a priming manipulation, the frequency or duration of prime stimuli can be varied. Two stimuli can be morphed continuously so that categorization boundaries can be examined.<label for="tufte-sn-114" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">114</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-114" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">114</span> These methods are extremely common in perception and psychophysics research, in part because the dimensions being studied are often continuous in nature. For exmaple, imagine trying to estimate a subject‚Äôs visual contrast sensitivity <em>without</em> continuously manipulating the contrast of the stimulus, eliciting judgments at many different levels.</span></p>

<p>Dose-response designs are useful because they provide insight into the shape of the function mapping your manipulation to your measure. Knowing this shape can inform your theoretical understanding! Consider the examples given in Figure <a href="#design-dose-schema"><strong>??</strong></a>. If you only have two conditions in your experiment, then the most you can say about the relationship between your manipulation and your measure is that it produces an effect of a particular magnitude; in essence, you are assuming that condition is a nominal variable. If you have multiple ordered levels of treatment, you can start to speculate about the nature of the relationship between treatment and effect magnitude. But if you can measure the strength of your treatment, then you can start to describe the nature of the relationship between the strength of treatment and strength of effect via a parametric function (e.g., a linear regression, a sigmoid, or other function).<label for="tufte-sn-115" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">115</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-115" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">115</span> These assumptions are theory-laden, of course ‚Äì the choice of a linear function or a sigmoid is not necessary: nothing guarantees that simple, smooth, or monotonic functions are the right ones. The important point from our perspective is that choosing a function makes explicit your assumptions about the nature of the treatment-effect relationship.</span> These parametric functions can in turn allow you to generalize from your experiment, making predictions about what would happen under intervention conditions that you didn‚Äôt measure directly!</p>
<p>This all can feel a bit abstract, so let‚Äôs consider an example. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brennan1966" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>brennan1966?</strong></a>)</span> were interested in the relationship between visual complexity and infants‚Äô looking preferences. Do infants uniformly prefer complex stimuli, or do they search for stimuli at an appropriate level of complexity for their processing abilities. To test this hypothesis, they exposed infants in three different age groups (3, 8, and 14 weeks, N=30) to black and white checkerboard stimuli with three different levels of complexity (2x2, 8x8, and 24x24). Their findings are plotted in Figure <a href="#design-dose-ex"><strong>??</strong></a>: the youngest infants preferred the simplest stimuli, while infants at an intermediate age preferred stimuli of intermediate complexity, and the oldest infants preferred the most complex stimuli. These findings help to motivate the theory that infants attend preferentially to stimuli that provide appropriate learning input for their processing ability <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kidd2012" role="doc-biblioref">Kidd et al., 2012</a>)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-116" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">116</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-116" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">116</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brennan1966" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>brennan1966?</strong></a>)</span>‚Äôs experiment uses a quantitative manipulation of complexity (checkerboard density). But they treat this manipulation as an ordinal ‚Äì rather than an interval ‚Äì variable, presumably because they do not know precisely how checkerboard density translates into changes in the psychological construct they care about, namely complexity. Does doubling the number of squares on the board double complexity, or do you have to double the number of squares on each side? Does complexity saturate, such that a 128x128 checkerboard is not much more complex? These are just a few of the questions that the dose-response approach raises.</span></p>

<p>If your goal is simply to detect whether an effect is zero or non-zero, then dose-response designs do not achieve the maximum statistical power. For example, if <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brennan1966" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>brennan1966?</strong></a>)</span> simply wanted to achieve maximal statistical power, they probably should have only tested two age groups and two levels of complexity (say, 3 and 14 week infants and 2x2 and 24x24 checkerboards). That would have been enough to show an interaction of complexity and age, and their greater resources devoted to these four (as opposed to nine) conditions would mean more precise estimates of each (simulated in Figure <a href="8-design.html#fig:design-dose-ex-2">8.8</a>). But their findings would be less clearly supportive of the view that infants prefer stimuli that are appropriate to their processing ability. By seeking to measure intermediate conditions, they provided a stronger constraint on their theory.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.2.2</span> Confounding</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs consider an alternate experiment now. Suppose we did the same basic procedure, but now with a ‚Äúwithin-subjects‚Äù design where participants do both the Dylan treatment and the control, in that order. This experiment is flawed, of course. If you observe a Dylan effect, you can‚Äôt rule out the idea that participants got tired and wrote worse in the control condition because it always came second.</p>
<p>Order (Dylan first vs.¬†control first; notated X‚Äô) is an experimental confound: a variable that is created in the course of the experiment that is both causally related to the predictor and potentially also related to the outcome. Here‚Äôs how the causal model now looks:</p>
<p>We‚Äôve reconstructed the same kind of confounding relationship we had with age, where we had a variable (X‚Äô) that was correlated both with our predictor (X) and our outcome (Y)! So‚Ä¶</p>
<p>In the causal language we have been using, counterbalancing allows us to snip out the causal dependency between order and Dylan. Now they are unconfounded (uncorrelated) with one another. We‚Äôve ‚Äúsolved‚Äù a confound in our experimental design. Here‚Äôs the picture:</p>
<p>These are not covariates! Covariates are related but don‚Äôt have causal force in this design because of randomization. We can use them in our analysis to make our estimates more precise (see Chapter <a href="6-models.html#models">6</a>), but we won‚Äôt worry about them here. If someone says to you, ‚Äúparticipant gender is a confound in your experiment,‚Äù if you‚Äôve done random assignment to condition appropriately (acoss genders), you should say ‚Äúno it‚Äôs not.‚Äù</p>
</div>
<div id="removing-nuisance-confounds" class="section level3" number="8.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.2.3</span> Removing nuisance confounds</h3>
<p>What should we do with our experimental confounds?</p>
<p>Option 1. Randomize. Increasingly, this is my go-to method for dealing with any confound. Is the correct answer on my survey confounded with response side? Randomize what side the response shows up on! Is order confounded with condition? Randomize the order you present in! Randomization is much easier now that we program many of our experiments using software like Qualtrics or code them from scratch in JavaScript.</p>
<p>The only time you really get in trouble with randomization is when you have a large number of options, a small number of participants, or some combination of the two. In this case, you can end up with unbalanced levels of the randomized factors (for example, ten answers on the right side and two on the left). Averaging across many experiments, this lack of balance will come out in the wash. But in a single experiment, it can really mess up your data ‚Äì especially if your participants notice and start choosing one side more than the other because it‚Äôs right more often. For that reason, when balance is critical, you want option 2.</p>
<p>Option 2. Counterbalance. If you think a particular confound might have a significant effect on your measure, balancing it across participants and across trials is a very safe choice. That way, you are guaranteed to have no effect of the confound on your average effect. In a simple counterbalance of order for our Dylan experiment, we manipulate condition order between subjects. Some participants hear Dylan first and others hear Dylan second. Although technically we might call order a second ‚Äúfactor‚Äù in the experiment, in practice it‚Äôs really just a nuisance variable, so we don‚Äôt talk about it as a factor and we often don‚Äôt analyze it (but see Option 3 below).</p>
<p>Counterbalancing doesn‚Äôt always work, though. It gets trickier when you have too many levels on a variable (too many Dylan songs!) or multiple confounding variables. For example, if you have lots of different nuisance variables ‚Äì say, condition order, what writing prompt you use for each order, which Dylan song you play ‚Äì it may not be possible to do a fully-crossed counterbalance so that all combinations of these factors are seen by equal numbers of participants. In these kinds of cases, you may have to rely on partial counterbalancing schemes or latin squares designs, or you may have to fall back on randomization.</p>
<p>Option 3. Do Options 1 and 2 and then model the variation. This option was never part of my training, but it‚Äôs an interesting third option that I‚Äôm increasingly considering.** That is, we are often faced with the choice between A) a noisy between-participants design and B) a lower-noise within-participants design that nevertheless adds noise back in via some obvious order effect that you have to randomize or counterbalance. In a recent talk by Andrew Gelman, he suggested that we try to model these as covariates, to reduce noise. This seems like a pretty interesting suggestion, especially if the correlation between them and the outcome is substantial.***</p>
