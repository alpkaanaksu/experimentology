<div class="learning-goals">
<p>üçé Learning goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write clearly by being concise, using structure, and centering the reader.</li>
<li>Write reproducibly by interleaving writing and analysis code.</li>
<li>Write responsibly by calibrating your conclusions, acknowledging limitations, and correcting errors.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>All of the effort you put into designing and running an effective experiment will be wasted if you cannot clearly communicate what you did<a href="E-instructors.html#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a>. Scientists usually share their research by writing journal articles. Writing is a powerful tool. Its a conversation that you contribute to only once, but it enables you to speak to a potentially infinite number of readers. So its important to get it right! In this chapter, you will learn how to communicate your research accurately and transparently by writing clearly, reproducibily, and responsibly.</p>
<div id="writing-clearly" class="section level2" number="15.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.1</span> Writing clearly</h2>
<p>What is the purpose of writing? ‚ÄúTelepathy, of course‚Äù says Stephen King <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-king" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>king?</strong></a>)</span>. The goal of writing is to transfer information from our mind to the reader‚Äôs mind as effectively as possible. Unfortunately, writing clearly does not come naturally to most of us; it is craft we need to work at. There are no strict rules of clear writing, but there are some generally accepted guidance and conventions that we will share with you here.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, you learn to write by reading and, unsurprisingly, by writing. Just as you learned to talk by imitating the speech of your parents and teachers, you can learn to write by imitating what you read. Unfortunately, a lot of scientific writing is not very clear, so you will need to be selective in what you choose to mimic. Fortunately, as a reader, you will know good writing when you see it ‚Äî you will feel like the writer is seamlessly transferring ideas from their mind to yours. When you come across writing like that, try to find more work by the same author and read that too. The more you read, the more you will develop a sense of what works well, and what does not. You may pick up bad habits as well as good ones (we sure have), but over time, your writing will improve if you make a conscious effort to weed out the bad, and keep ahold of the good.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Be explicit</strong>. Leaving the meaning of your writing to the reader‚Äôs imagination is dangerous because different readers may imagine different things! So say what you mean as directly and precisely as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be concrete</strong>. Ideas are often easier to convey when you provide examples. For example‚Ä¶ Use figures and diagrams - for example, to describe a series of participant exclusions, use a flow diagram. If the journal limits the number of figures you can use, make use of the supplementary materials. Use videos and screen capture software to convey methods or interactions with participants <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-heycke2019" role="doc-biblioref">Heycke &amp; Spitzer, 2019</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be consistent</strong>. Referring to the same concept using different words can confuse the reader. It may not be clear if you are using a synonym or referring to a different idea. Define technical terms once and then use the same wording throughout the manuscript. For example, in everyday conversation, ‚Äúreplication‚Äù and ‚Äúreproducibility‚Äù may sound like two different ways to refer to the same thing, but in scientific writing, these two concepts have different definitions so we should not use them interchangeably.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Define terminology</strong>. Sticking with the example of ‚Äúreplication‚Äù and ‚Äúreproducibility‚Äù, some fields have a traditionally defined these terms in opposite ways!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be concise</strong>. Its much easier to hear someone shouting your name in an empty field than in a forest. Maximise the signal to noise ratio in your writing by omitting needless words and removing clutter [cite strunk and white]. For example, say <strong>we investigated</strong> rather than <em>we performed an investigation of</em> and say <strong>if</strong> rather than <em>in the event that</em>. Don‚Äôt try to convey everything you know about a topic ‚Äî a research report is not an essay. Decide what information you need to convey and focus only on that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use active voice</strong>. Scientists have a peculiar habit of reporting their research in a way that avoids mentioning their own involvement. For example, its common to see phrases like ‚Äúthe data were analysed‚Äù or, worse, ‚Äúan analysis of the data was carried out‚Äù. These are examples of ‚Äòpassive voice‚Äô. Scientists might write like this because it seems more objective, but that‚Äôs just an illusion. Moreover, passive voice is often long-winded and ambiguous ‚Äî the reader is left uncertain as to who or what analyzed the data. Was it the researchers? A statistician they recruited? Artificial intelligence? We think its better to use the ‚Äòactive voice‚Äô, where you clearly identify the relevant actor; in this example, you can say ‚Äúwe analyzed the data‚Äù. Another common example is the phrase ‚Äúit is believed that‚Äù which leaves the reader unsure as to who is doing the believing. Be explicit, for example, ‚Äúwe believe that‚Äù or ‚Äúscientists believe that‚Äù.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adjust to your audience</strong>. Most of us adjust our conversation style depending on who we‚Äôre talking to ‚Äî the same applies to good writing. Knowing your audience is more difficult with writing, because our part of the conversation is one-sided ‚Äî we cannot see the reader and adjust accordingly. Nevertheless, we can make some educated guesses about who our readers might be. For example, if you are writing a review article for an interdisciplinary journal, you may need to pay more attention to explaining complex topics for a novice readership compared to writing a research article in a domain-specific journal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check your understanding</strong>. Unclear writing can be a symptom of unclear thinking. If it doesn‚Äôt make sense in your head, how will it ever make sense on the page? In fact, trying to communicate something in writing is an excellent way to probe your own understanding and expose weaknesses in your own arguments. So if you are finding it difficult to write clearly, take a step back and ask yourself <strong>do I know what want to say</strong>? If your thinking is unclear then you need to address that directly, for example by consulting a textbook or talk to your colleagues/advisor. Importantly, you must resist the temptation to mask unclear thinking in unclear writing, for example by being deliberately ambiguous (poss historical note here on alchemy). Sometimes, your thinking will be unclear simply because <em>nobody</em> understands the topic you are addressing. Indeed, we should expect that to happen; the whole point of research is to expand the frontiers of human knowledge, so naturally, you will find yourself working on the faultline of what is and what is not well understood. So if you have unresolveable uncertainty about something, say so explicitly, don‚Äôt hide it in bad writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use acronyms sparingly</strong>. Its tempting to replace technical terminology with acronyms ‚Äî why say ‚Äúcognitive dissonance theory‚Äù when you can say ‚ÄúCDT‚Äù? Unfortunately, acronyms can increase the cognitive burden on the reader and can lead to misunderstandings<a href="E-instructors.html#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a>. For example, if you shorten ‚Äúodds ratio‚Äù to ‚ÄúOR‚Äù, the reader has to take the extra step of translating ‚ÄúOR‚Äù back to ‚Äúodds ratio‚Äù every time they encounter it. The problem multiplies as you introduce more acronyms into your article. Worse, for some readers, ‚ÄúOR‚Äù tends to ‚Äúoperating room‚Äù, not ‚Äúodds ratio‚Äù. Acronyms can be useful, but usually only when they are widely used and understood. For example, ‚Äúmagnetic resonance imaging‚Äù (‚ÄúMRI‚Äù) and ‚Äúdeoxyribonucleic acid‚Äù (DNA). At a minimum though, you should define all acronyms, even when they are likely to be familiar to most readers.</p></li>

</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use structure</strong>. Without structure, your reader would be left adrift in an ocean of complexity. Give them anchor points to hold on to. Academic writing is usually organised into a hierarchy of meaningful units: sections, paragraphs, sentences, and words. <a href="E-instructors.html#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Section structure</strong>. Reading a scientific paper is not like reading a novel. Rather than reading from beginning to end, readers typically jump efficiently between sections to extract the information they need. This is possible because research articles typically follow the same conventional<a href="E-instructors.html#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> structure (see Figure in side panel). The main body of the article includes four main sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRaD)<a href="E-instructors.html#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a>. This structure has a narrative logic: what‚Äôs the knowledge gap? (introduction); how did you address it (methods); what did you find (results); what do the results mean? (discussion).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hourglass structure</strong>. Its helpful to imagine that the body of your article has an ‚Äòhourglass‚Äô structure (see Figure in panel). At the start of the introduction, you should have a broad focus ‚Äî provide the reader with the general context of your study. From there, the focus of the introduction should get increasingly narrow until you are describing the specific problem you will address and how you are going to address it. The methods and results sections are at the center of the hourglass because they are focused on your study alone. In the discussion section, the focus shifts from narrow to broad. Begin by summarising the results of your study, discuss limitations, then integrate the findings with existing literature and describe the practical and theoretical implications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paragraph structure</strong>. The ‚ÄòP-E-E-L‚Äô (Point-Explain-Evidence-Link) structure is a helpful way to organise your paragraphs, particularly in the introduction and discussion sections. Each paragraph should convey one main idea, which you should state as clearly as possible in the first sentence. The core of the paragraph is dedicated to further explaining the point (perhaps with another ‚ÄòE‚Äô ‚Äî an example) and providing evidence. There‚Äôs considerable flexibility here ‚Äî you might provide several lines of evidence and the order of explain and evidence is interchangeable). Finally, take a couple of sentence to remind the reader of your main point and set up a link to the next paragraph. Think of it like a relay race where the baton (your argument) is passed seamlessly between paragraphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sentence structure</strong>. Long, complex sentences can be confusing and difficult to process. On the other hand, if you only use short sentences your writing may sound like a monotonous robot. Don‚Äôt try to cram too much information into the same sentence and vary the lengths to give your prose clarity and rhythm. Use sentence structure as a scaffold to support the reader‚Äôs thinking. Start sentences with what the reader already knows before introducing new information. For example, write ‚ÄúTo address the cognitive dissonance hypothesis, we compared performance in the experimental group and control group using a between-subjects t-test‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúWe performed a between-subjects t-test comparing performance in the experimental and control groups to address the cognitive dissonance hypothesis.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-referencing</strong>. Research articles are packed with complex information and its easy for readers to get lost. A ‚Äòcross reference‚Äô is like a helpful signpost that tells readers where they can find relevant information. For example, you can refer the reader to data visualizations by cross referencing to figures or tables (‚Äúsee Figure 1‚Äù), or methodological information in the supplementary information (‚Äúsee Supplementary Information A‚Äù). You can also cross reference your research aims/hypotheses to remind readers how different methods, results, and inferences relate back to your research goals. For example, you could add separate sub-headings in your results section to address hypotheses A, B, and C.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Rewrite</strong>. Think of the article you are writing as a garden. Your first draft is probably going to be an unruly mess of intertwined fronds and branches. Writing usually needs several rounds of pruning and sculpting before it reaches its most impressive form. You‚Äôll be amazed how often you find words to omit, terms you can define more precisely, or elaborate sentence structures you can simplify. <a href="E-instructors.html#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get feedback</strong>. It can be difficult to judge if our own writing has achieved its telepathic goals. If possible, try to get feedback from a naive reader, preferably somebody from your target audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The reader is (usually) right</strong>. Its tempting to blame the reader when your writing fails. Criticism can sting, especially after spending many hours writing and rewriting. But if a reader has gone to the effort of sharing feedback with you, its probably a reasonable assumption that they‚Äôve made a reasonable effort at understanding your writing. And if they didn‚Äôt understand your writing, you need to fix it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have fun</strong>. Scientific writing has a reputation for being dull, dry, <em>soulless</em>. Whilst its true that scientific writing is more constrained than fiction, there are still ways to surprise and entertain your reader with metaphor, alliteration, and even humour. As long as your writing is clear and accurate, we see no reason why you cant also make it enjoyable. Enjoyable articles are easier to read and more fun to write.</p></li>

<div id="writing-reproducibly" class="section level2" number="15.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.2</span> Writing reproducibly</h2>
<p>In previous chapters (cross-ref) you learned how research results are sometimes not reproducible ‚Äî that is, they cannot be recreated by repeating the original analyses on the original data. Fortunately, there are number of tools and techniques available that you can use to write reproducible research reports. The basic idea is to interleave your analysis code with the main text of your article.</p>
<div id="why-write-reproducible-papers" class="section level3" number="15.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.2.1</span> Why write reproducible papers?</h3>
<p>There are at least three reasons to write reproducible reports:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Accuracy</strong>. Data analysis is an error-prone activity. Without safeguards in place, it can be easy to accidentally overwrite data, mislabel experimental conditions, or copy and paste the wrong statistics. One study found that nearly half of around 30,000 published psychology papers contained statistical reporting errors; 10% of reported p-values were inconsistent with other reported details of the statistical test, and 1.6% were ‚Äúgrossly‚Äù inconsistent (the difference between the p-value and the test statistic meant that one value implied statistical significance and the other did not) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nuijten2016" role="doc-biblioref">Nuijten et al., 2016</a>)</span>. You can reduce opportunities for error by adopting a reproducible analysis workflow that avoids error-prone manual actions, like copying and pasting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transparency</strong>. Technical information about data analysis can be difficult to communicate in writing ‚Äî written prose is often ambiguous and its possible to leave out important details <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hardwicke2018b" role="doc-biblioref">Hardwicke et al., 2018</a>)</span>. By contrast, a reproducible workflow documents the entire analysis pipeline from raw data to research report exactly as it was performed (<a href="13-management.html#fig:chain">13.3</a>). This directly communicates to other researchers the exact origin of any reported values allowing them to assess, verify, and repeat the analysis process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>. Data analysis often involves repeating the same steps. For example, you may run your analysis and realize you forgot to perform the data exclusions. You may produce a graph and decide you‚Äôd prefer a different colour scheme. Or perhaps you want to output the same results table in a pdf document to submit to a journal and in a Powerpoint slide for a presentation. In a reproducible workflow, all of the analysis steps are scripted, and can be easily re-run at the click of a button. You (and others) can re-use parts of your code in other projects, rather than having to re-write everything from scratch.</p></li>

<p>Here we outline some general principles of reproducible writing. To learn how to implement these principles in practice, please see Appendix‚Ä¶ LINK.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Never break the chain</strong>. Every step of the analysis pipeline should be linked together programmatically (i.e., by computer code). This allows everything to be re-run from scratch without any requiring any manual actions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script everything</strong>. Try to ensure that each step of the analysis pipeline is executed by computer code rather than manual actions, like copy and paste. This ensures that every step is documented in its most literal form, ensuring it can be reproduced. Imagine, for example, that you decided to recode a variable in your dataset. You could use the ‚Äòfind and replace‚Äô function in Excel, but this action would not be documented ‚Äî you might even forget that you did it! A better option would be to write an R script.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use literate programming</strong>. The meaning of a chunk of computer code is not always obvious to another user, especially if they‚Äôre not an expert. Indeed, we frequently look at our own code and scratch our heads wondering what on earth its doing. To avoid this, its helpful to frequently insert plain language comments into your code ‚Äî a style known as ‚Äòliterate programming‚Äô because you spell out literally what the code is doing <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-knuth1992" role="doc-biblioref">Knuth, 1992</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use defensive programming</strong>. Errors can still occur in scripted analyses. Defensive programming is the idea that we should try to anticipate, detect, and avoid errors in advance. A typical defensive programming tool is the inclusion of ‚Äòtests‚Äô in your computer code. For example, let‚Äôs say that 200 participants took part in your study. You pass your data through a series of preprocessing steps and then apply some functions to generate summary statistics. After the preprocessing, it would be helpful to include a brief line of code that checks if there are still 200 participants included in the dataset and you haven‚Äôt inadvertently excluded any.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use free/open-source software</strong>. If possible, avoid using commercial software, like SPSS or Matlab, and instead use free, open-source software, like JASP, Jamovi, R, or Python. This will make it easier for others to access, reuse, and verify your work - including yourself! It would be very unfortunate to have spent your PhD learning Matlab and then find your new employer does not have a Matlab software license.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use version control</strong>. In Chapter 14 (see Appendix B for tutorial), we introduced you to the benefits of version control - a great way to incrementally save your analysis pipeline as you build it, helping you to roll-back to previous version if you accidentally introduce errors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preserve the computational environment</strong>. Even if your analysis pipeline is entirely reproducible on your own computer, you still need to consider whether it will run on somebody else‚Äôs computer, or even your own computer after you have updated your software. You can address this by documenting and preserving the computational environment in which the analysis pipeline runs successfully. Various tools are available to help with this, such as Code Ocean, renv (for R), and pip (for Python).</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.2.3</span> The reproducibiltiy-collaboration trade-off</h3>
<p>We would love to just leave it here and watch you walk off into the sunset with a spring in your step and a reproducible report under your arm, end of story. Unfortunately, we have to admit that writing reproducibly can create a few practical difficulties when it comes to collaboration. A major aspect of collaboration is exchanging comments and inline text edits with co-authors. You can do this with R Markdown files and Git, but these tools are not as user-friendly as, say, Word or Google Docs and many collaborators will be completely unfamiliar with them. Most journals also expect articles to be submitted as Word documents and outputing R Markdown files to Word can often introduce formatting issues, especially for moderately complex Tables. So until more user-friendly tools are introduced, some compromise between reproducibility and collaboration may be necessary. Here are three workflow styles we have used in our own work:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>maximal reproducibility</strong>* approach. If your collaborators are familiar with R Markdown and you don‚Äôt mind exchanging comments and edits via Git, then you can maintain a fully reproducible workflow for your project, at least up until you release a preprint of your work. The journal submission and publication process may still introduce some issues (like incorporating changes made by the copy editor), but at least your preprint will be fully reproducible.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>two worlds</strong> approach. This workflow is a bit clunky, but it facilitates collaboration and maintains reproducibility. Firstly, generate your results section via R Markdown and export to a Word document. Copy and paste the entire results section into an empty Google Doc. Write the remainder of the manuscript in the Google Doc, including incorporating comments and changes from collaborators. When everyone‚Äôs happy you have a final version, copy and paste the abstract, introduction, methods, and discussion into the R Markdown document. Integrate any changes made to the results section requires a bit more effort. Save the Google Doc as a Word document and compare it to the original Word results section using Word‚Äôs ‚Äúcompare documents‚Äù feature. New changes will be highlighted. Manually integrate the changes into the R Markdown file. You can use ‚Äúcompare documents‚Äù again to ensure the version of the Word document generate by your R Markdown file aligns with the one you wrote with your collaborators (barring some formatting differences). The advantage of this approach is that you have a reproducible document and your collaborators have not had to deviate from their preferred workflow. Unfortunately, it requires more effort from you.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>reproducibility-lite</strong> approach. !!! Actually not sure what this is‚Ä¶ seems similar to above.</p></li>

<div id="writing-responsibly" class="section level2" number="15.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.3</span> Writing responsibly</h2>
<p>No study is perfect. Even the most rigorously designed research will have limitations, simply because doing science is hard! Errors are also likely to occur, because we‚Äôre only human, and we make mistakes.</p>
<p>Its not your responsibility to design perfect studies or never make a mistake. But it <em>is</em> your responsibility to handle limitations and errors in a transparent and professional manner <a href="E-instructors.html#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a>. It also your responsibility to communicate all relevant information about your study to enable other scientists to make an informed assessment. This includes methodological information, but also additional contextual information, like potential conflicts of interest or deviations from a preregistration. Finally, you will need to meet some scholarly obligations with regards to authorship and citations.</p>
<div id="responsible-disclosure-and-interpretation" class="section level3" number="15.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.3.1</span> Responsible disclosure and interpretation</h3>
<p><strong>Show your work</strong>. Back in school, we all learned that getting the right answer is not enough, you need to demonstrate how you arrived at that answer in order to get full marks. The same expectation applies to research reports. Don‚Äôt just tell the reader what you found, tell them how you found it. That means providing <em>all</em> methodological details<a href="E-instructors.html#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a>. You do have some flexibility in terms of how much detail you provide in the main body and how much you relegate to the supplementary information. Readers have different needs; some may just want to know the highlights, and some will want to replicate your study and therefore need all the details. As a rule-of-thumb, try to make sure there is nothing in the supplementary information that would surprise the reader. You certainty should not use the supplementary information to hide important details or use it as a disorganized dumping ground - the principles of clear writing still apply here!</p>
<p><strong>Don‚Äôt overclaim</strong>. Unfortunately, scientists often feel (and often are) evaluated based on the results of their research rather than the quality of the research. Consequently, it can be tempting to make bigger and bolder claims about your research than are really justified by the evidence. Think carefully about the limitations of your research and calibrate your conclusions to the evidence your have obtained, rather than what you hope to be able to claim. Ensure that your conclusions are appropriately stated throughtout the manuscript, including the title and abstract<a href="E-instructors.html#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Discuss, don‚Äôt debate</strong>. In the discussion section, your job is to help the reader interpret your research. Importantly, it is not a debate - don‚Äôt feel the need to argue dogmatically for a particular position or interpretation <a href="E-instructors.html#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a>. You should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence you can obtained, and the reletive merits of different interpretations. For example, perhaps there is a potential confounding variable that you were unable to eliminate with your research design. The reader might be able to spot this themselves, but regardless, its your responsibility to highlight it for them. Perhaps on balance you think the confound is unlikely to explain the results - that‚Äôs fine, but you need to explain your reasoning to the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Disclose conflicts of interest and funding</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>preregistration and deviation</p></li>
<li><p>discussing limitations (vazire &amp; hoekstra)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>journal constraints may undermine your efforts to provide comprehensive methods details etc, but usually they are fine with your linking to supplementary information on OSF. That does not exclude leaving out important information from the main report. Many readers won‚Äôt dig into the supplement so its your responsibility to make sure they are properly informed. If you feel journal constraints are undermining your ability to be transparent about your research, you should go to a different journal. (e.g., RSOS, Collabra Psychology)</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.3.3</span> Responsbile authorship and citation</h3>
<p><strong>Cite responsibility</strong>. Science is a community cite others when building on their work. Read before you cite. The meaning of a citation is often implicit in the context - but make sure it is clear why your are citing e.g., is it empirical evidence to support a claim? A review of evidence? An idea or theory? A method? A counterargument? There are examples in Gernsbacher‚Äôs article of citation misuse. Avoid selective citation. Evaluate and integrate evidence rather than simply listing studies that appear to support your argument. Remember every study has limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge authors contributors</strong>. There are two key decisions to make about authorship: (1) Who qualifies as an author? (2) What is the authorship order?</p>
