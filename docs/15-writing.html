<ul>
<li>Write clearly by being concise, using structure, and centering the reader.</li>
<li>Write reproducibly by interleaving writing and analysis code.</li>
<li>Write responsibly by calibrating your conclusions, acknowledging limitations, and correcting errors.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>All of the effort you put into designing and running an effective experiment will be wasted if you cannot clearly communicate what you did<label for="tufte-sn-225" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">225</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-225" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">225</span> clarity of communication was one of the foundational principles of modern science. Alchemists had a habit of deliberately obscuring their work ‚Äî sometimes even writing in cryptic codes. Francis Bacon and Robert Boyle pushed for transparency and clarity. Notoriously, Issac Newton (an alchemist turned scientist), continued to deliberately write in an obscure fashion in order to ‚Äòprotect‚Äô his work. See Stephen Heard book chapter 1.</span>. Scientists usually share their research by writing journal articles. Writing is a powerful tool. Its a conversation that you contribute to only once, but it enables you to speak to a potentially infinite number of readers. So its important to get it right! In this chapter, you will learn how to communicate your research accurately and transparently by writing clearly, reproducibily, and responsibly.</p>
<div id="writing-clearly" class="section level2" number="15.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.1</span> Writing clearly</h2>
<p>What is the purpose of writing? ‚ÄúTelepathy, of course‚Äù says Stephen King <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-king" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>king?</strong></a>)</span>. The goal of writing is to transfer information from our mind to the reader‚Äôs mind as effectively as possible. Unfortunately, writing clearly does not come naturally to most of us; it is craft we need to work at. There are no strict rules of clear writing, but there are some generally accepted guidance and conventions that we will share with you here.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, you learn to write by reading and, unsurprisingly, by writing. Just as you learned to talk by imitating the speech of your parents and teachers, you can learn to write by imitating what you read. Unfortunately, a lot of scientific writing is not very clear, so you will need to be selective in what you choose to mimic. Fortunately, as a reader, you will know good writing when you see it ‚Äî you will feel like the writer is seamlessly transferring ideas from their mind to yours. When you come across writing like that, try to find more work by the same author and read that too. The more you read, the more you will develop a sense of what works well, and what does not. You may pick up bad habits as well as good ones (we sure have), but over time, your writing will improve if you make a conscious effort to weed out the bad, and keep ahold of the good.</p>
<div id="use-words-wisely" class="section level3" number="15.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.1.1</span> Use words wisely</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Be explicit</strong>. Avoid vagueness and ambiguity. Leaving the meaning of your writing to the reader‚Äôs imagination is dangerous because different readers may imagine different things! So be direct and specific.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be concrete</strong>. Ideas are often easier to convey when you provide examples. For example‚Ä¶ Use figures and diagrams - for example, to describe a series of participant exclusions, use a flow diagram. If the journal limits the number of figures you can use, make use of the supplementary materials. Use videos and screen capture software to convey methods or interactions with participants <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-heycke2019" role="doc-biblioref">Heycke &amp; Spitzer, 2019</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be consistent</strong>. Referring to the same concept using different words can confuse the reader. It may not be clear if you are using a synonym or referring to a different idea. Define technical terms once and then use the same wording throughout the manuscript. For example, in everyday conversation, ‚Äúreplication‚Äù and ‚Äúreproducibility‚Äù may sound like two different ways to refer to the same thing, but in scientific writing, these two concepts have different definitions so we should not use them interchangeably.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Define terminology</strong>. Sticking with the example of ‚Äúreplication‚Äù and ‚Äúreproducibility‚Äù, some fields have a traditionally defined these terms in opposite ways!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be concise</strong>. Its much easier to hear someone shouting your name in an empty field than in a forest. Maximise the signal to noise ratio in your writing by omitting needless words and removing clutter [cite strunk and white]. For example, say <em>we investigated</em> rather than <em>we performed an investigation of</em> and say <em>if</em> rather than <em>in the event that</em>. Don‚Äôt try to convey everything you know about a topic ‚Äî a research report is not an essay. Decide what information you need to convey and focus only on that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use active voice</strong>. Scientists have a peculiar habit of reporting their research in a way that avoids mentioning their own involvement. For example, its common to see phrases like ‚Äúthe data were analysed‚Äù or, worse, ‚Äúan analysis of the data was carried out‚Äù. These are examples of ‚Äòpassive voice‚Äô. Scientists might write like this because it seems more objective, but that‚Äôs just an illusion. Moreover, passive voice is often long-winded and ambiguous ‚Äî the reader is left uncertain as to who or what analyzed the data. Was it the researchers? A statistician they recruited? Artificial intelligence? We think its better to use the ‚Äòactive voice‚Äô, where you clearly identify the relevant actor; in this example, you can say ‚Äúwe analyzed the data‚Äù. Another common example is the phrase ‚Äúit is believed that‚Äù which leaves the reader unsure as to who is doing the believing. Be explicit, for example, ‚Äúwe believe that‚Äù or ‚Äúscientists believe that‚Äù.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adjust to your audience</strong>. Most of us adjust our conversation style depending on who we‚Äôre talking to ‚Äî the same applies to good writing. Knowing your audience is more difficult with writing, because our part of the conversation is one-sided ‚Äî we cannot see the reader and adjust accordingly. Nevertheless, we can make some educated guesses about who our readers might be. For example, if you are writing a review article for an interdisciplinary journal, you may need to pay more attention to explaining complex topics for a novice readership compared to writing a research article in a domain-specific journal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check your understanding</strong>. Unclear writing can be a symptom of unclear thinking. If it doesn‚Äôt make sense in your head, how will it ever make sense on the page? In fact, trying to communicate something in writing is an excellent way to probe your own understanding and expose weaknesses in your own arguments. So if you are finding it difficult to write clearly, take a step back and ask yourself <strong>do I know what want to say</strong>? If your thinking is unclear then you need to address that directly, for example by consulting a textbook or talk to your colleagues/advisor. Importantly, you must resist the temptation to mask unclear thinking in unclear writing, for example by being deliberately ambiguous (poss historical note here on alchemy). Sometimes, your thinking will be unclear simply because <em>nobody</em> understands the topic you are addressing. Indeed, we should expect that to happen; the whole point of research is to expand the frontiers of human knowledge, so naturally, you will find yourself working on the faultline of what is and what is not well understood. So if you have unresolveable uncertainty about something, say so explicitly, don‚Äôt hide it in bad writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use acronyms sparingly</strong>. Its tempting to replace technical terminology with acronyms ‚Äî why say ‚Äúcognitive dissonance theory‚Äù when you can say ‚ÄúCDT‚Äù? Unfortunately, acronyms can increase the cognitive burden on the reader and can lead to misunderstandings<label for="tufte-sn-226" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">226</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-226" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">226</span> <span class="citation">Barnett &amp; Doubleday (<a href="#ref-barnett2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> found that acronyms are widely used in research articles and argued that they are often a barrier to clear communication. Here is one example of text extracted from a 2019 publication to illustrate the point: ‚ÄúApplying PROBAST showed that ADO, B-AE-D, B-AE-D-C, extended ADO, updated ADO, updated BODE, and a model developed by Bertens et al were derived in studies assessed as being at low risk of bias.‚Äô</span>. For example, if you shorten ‚Äúodds ratio‚Äù to ‚ÄúOR‚Äù, the reader has to take the extra step of translating ‚ÄúOR‚Äù back to ‚Äúodds ratio‚Äù every time they encounter it. The problem multiplies as you introduce more acronyms into your article. Worse, for some readers, ‚ÄúOR‚Äù tends to ‚Äúoperating room‚Äù, not ‚Äúodds ratio‚Äù. Acronyms can be useful, but usually only when they are widely used and understood. For example, ‚Äúmagnetic resonance imaging‚Äù (‚ÄúMRI‚Äù) and ‚Äúdeoxyribonucleic acid‚Äù (DNA). At a minimum though, you should define all acronyms, even when they are likely to be familiar to most readers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have fun</strong>. Scientific writing has a reputation for being dull, dry, <em>soulless</em>. Whilst its true that scientific writing is more constrained than fiction, there are still ways to surprise and entertain your reader with metaphor, alliteration, and even humour. As long as your writing is clear and accurate, we see no reason why you cant also make it enjoyable. Enjoyable articles are easier to read and more fun to write.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="use-structure" class="section level3" number="15.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.1.2</span> Use structure</h3>
<p>Without structure, your reader would be left adrift in an ocean of complexity. Give them anchor points to hold on to. Academic writing is usually organised into a hierarchy of meaningful units: sections, paragraphs, sentences, and words. <label for="tufte-sn-227" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">227</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-227" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">227</span> Structure helps your reader, but it can also help you write. Start writing your article with section headings as a skeleton structure, then flesh it out, layer by layer. In each section, make a list of the key points you want to convey, these represent the first sentence of each paragraph (see P-E-E-L below). Then add the content of each paragraph.</span></p>

</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Section structure</strong>. Reading a scientific paper is not like reading a novel. Rather than reading from beginning to end, readers typically jump efficiently between sections to extract the information they need. This is possible because research articles typically follow the same conventional<label for="tufte-sn-228" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">228</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-228" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">228</span> Some journals mix things up a bit, for example, putting the methods section at the end of the article or combining the results and discussion sections; however, most psychology journals tend to follow the guidance of the American Psychological Association, which recommends IMRaD.</span> structure (see Figure in side panel). The main body of the article includes four main sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRaD)<label for="tufte-sn-229" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">229</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-229" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">229</span> In the old old days, there were few conventions - scientists would often write letters to each other in order to share their latest findings. But as the number of scientists and studies increased, this approach became unsustainable. The IMRaD convention gained traction in the 1800s and emerged as the dominant approach in the mid-1900s as scientific productivity rapidly expanded in the post-war era. We think this is a big improvement, even if its nice to get a letter every now and again.</span>. This structure has a narrative logic: what‚Äôs the knowledge gap? (introduction); how did you address it (methods); what did you find (results); what do the results mean? (discussion).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hourglass structure</strong>. Its helpful to imagine that the body of your article has an ‚Äòhourglass‚Äô structure (see Figure in panel). At the start of the introduction, you should have a broad focus ‚Äî provide the reader with the general context of your study. From there, the focus of the introduction should get increasingly narrow until you are describing the specific problem you will address and how you are going to address it. The methods and results sections are at the center of the hourglass because they are focused on your study alone. In the discussion section, the focus shifts from narrow to broad. Begin by summarising the results of your study, discuss limitations, then integrate the findings with existing literature and describe the practical and theoretical implications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paragraph structure</strong>. The ‚ÄòP-E-E-L‚Äô (Point-Explain-Evidence-Link) structure is a helpful way to organise your paragraphs, particularly in the introduction and discussion sections. Each paragraph should convey one main idea, which you should state as clearly as possible in the first sentence. The core of the paragraph is dedicated to further explaining the point (perhaps with another ‚ÄòE‚Äô ‚Äî an example) and providing evidence. There‚Äôs considerable flexibility here ‚Äî you might provide several lines of evidence and the order of explain and evidence is interchangeable). Finally, take a couple of sentence to remind the reader of your main point and set up a link to the next paragraph. Think of it like a relay race where the baton (your argument) is passed seamlessly between paragraphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sentence structure</strong>. Long, complex sentences can be confusing and difficult to process. On the other hand, if you only use short sentences your writing may sound like a monotonous robot. Don‚Äôt try to cram too much information into the same sentence and vary the lengths to give your prose clarity and rhythm. Use sentence structure as a scaffold to support the reader‚Äôs thinking. Start sentences with what the reader already knows before introducing new information. For example, write ‚ÄúTo address the cognitive dissonance hypothesis, we compared performance in the experimental group and control group using a between-subjects t-test‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúWe performed a between-subjects t-test comparing performance in the experimental and control groups to address the cognitive dissonance hypothesis.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-referencing</strong>. Research articles are packed with complex information and its easy for readers to get lost. A ‚Äòcross reference‚Äô is like a helpful signpost that tells readers where they can find relevant information. For example, you can refer the reader to data visualizations by cross referencing to figures or tables (‚Äúsee Figure 1‚Äù), or methodological information in the supplementary information (‚Äúsee Supplementary Information A‚Äù). You can also cross reference your research aims/hypotheses to remind readers how different methods, results, and inferences relate back to your research goals. For example, you could add separate sub-headings in your results section to address hypotheses A, B, and C.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.2</span> Drafting</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get feedback</strong>. It can be difficult to judge if our own writing has achieved its telepathic goals. If possible, try to get feedback from a naive reader, preferably somebody from your target audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The reader is (usually) right</strong>. Its tempting to blame the reader when your writing fails. Criticism can sting, especially after spending many hours writing and rewriting. But if a reader has gone to the effort of sharing feedback with you, its probably a reasonable assumption that they‚Äôve made a reasonable effort at understanding your writing. And if they didn‚Äôt understand your writing, you need to fix it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rewrite</strong>. Think of the article you are writing as a garden. Your first draft is probably going to be an unruly mess of intertwined fronds and branches. Writing usually needs several rounds of pruning and sculpting before it reaches its most impressive form. You‚Äôll be amazed how often you find words to omit, terms you can define more precisely, or elaborate sentence structures you can simplify. <label for="tufte-sn-230" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">230</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-230" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">230</span> On the other hand, don‚Äôt be paralysed by perfectionism.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.3</span> Writing reproducibly</h2>
<p>In chapters <a href="3-replication.html#replication">3</a> you learned how research results are sometimes not reproducible ‚Äî that is, they cannot be recreated by repeating the original analyses on the original data. Fortunately, there are number of tools and techniques available that you can use to write reproducible research reports. The basic idea is to interleave your analysis code with the main text of your article.</p>
<div id="why-write-reproducible-papers" class="section level3" number="15.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.3.1</span> Why write reproducible papers?</h3>
<p>There are at least three reasons to write reproducible reports:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Accuracy</strong>. Data analysis is an error-prone activity. Without safeguards in place, it can be easy to accidentally overwrite data, mislabel experimental conditions, or copy and paste the wrong statistics. One study found that nearly half of around 30,000 published psychology papers contained statistical reporting errors; 10% of reported p-values were inconsistent with other reported details of the statistical test, and 1.6% were ‚Äúgrossly‚Äù inconsistent (the difference between the p-value and the test statistic meant that one value implied statistical significance and the other did not) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nuijten2016" role="doc-biblioref">Nuijten et al., 2016</a>)</span>. You can reduce opportunities for error by adopting a reproducible analysis workflow that avoids error-prone manual actions, like copying and pasting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transparency</strong>. Technical information about data analysis can be difficult to communicate in writing ‚Äî written prose is often ambiguous and its possible to leave out important details <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hardwicke2018b" role="doc-biblioref">Hardwicke et al., 2018</a>)</span>. By contrast, a reproducible workflow documents the entire analysis pipeline from raw data to research report exactly as it was performed (<a href="13-management.html#fig:chain">13.3</a>). This directly communicates to other researchers the exact origin of any reported values allowing them to assess, verify, and repeat the analysis process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>. Data analysis often involves repeating the same steps. For example, you may run your analysis and realize you forgot to perform the data exclusions. You may produce a graph and decide you‚Äôd prefer a different colour scheme. Or perhaps you want to output the same results table in a pdf document to submit to a journal and in a Powerpoint slide for a presentation. In a reproducible workflow, all of the analysis steps are scripted, and can be easily re-run at the click of a button. You (and others) can re-use parts of your code in other projects, rather than having to re-write everything from scratch.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="principles-of-reproducible-writing" class="section level3" number="15.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.3.2</span> Principles of reproducible writing</h3>
<p>Here we outline some general principles of reproducible writing. To learn how to implement these principles in practice, please see Appendix <a href="B-rmarkdown.html#rmarkdown">B</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Never break the chain</strong>. Every step of the analysis pipeline should be linked together programmatically (i.e., by computer code). This allows everything to be re-run from scratch without any requiring any manual actions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script everything</strong>. Try to ensure that each step of the analysis pipeline is executed by computer code rather than manual actions, like copy and paste. This ensures that every step is documented in its most literal form, ensuring it can be reproduced. Imagine, for example, that you decided to recode a variable in your dataset. You could use the ‚Äòfind and replace‚Äô function in Excel, but this action would not be documented ‚Äî you might even forget that you did it! A better option would be to write an R script.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use literate programming</strong>. The meaning of a chunk of computer code is not always obvious to another user, especially if they‚Äôre not an expert. Indeed, we frequently look at our own code and scratch our heads wondering what on earth its doing. To avoid this, its helpful to frequently insert plain language comments into your code ‚Äî a style known as ‚Äòliterate programming‚Äô because you spell out literally what the code is doing <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-knuth1992" role="doc-biblioref">Knuth, 1992</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use defensive programming</strong>. Errors can still occur in scripted analyses. Defensive programming is the idea that we should try to anticipate, detect, and avoid errors in advance. A typical defensive programming tool is the inclusion of ‚Äòtests‚Äô in your computer code. For example, let‚Äôs say that 200 participants took part in your study. You pass your data through a series of preprocessing steps and then apply some functions to generate summary statistics. After the preprocessing, it would be helpful to include a brief line of code that checks if there are still 200 participants included in the dataset and you haven‚Äôt inadvertently excluded any.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use free/open-source software</strong>. If possible, avoid using commercial software, like SPSS or Matlab, and instead use free, open-source software, like JASP, Jamovi, R, or Python. This will make it easier for others to access, reuse, and verify your work - including yourself! It would be very unfortunate to have spent your PhD learning Matlab and then find your new employer does not have a Matlab software license.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use version control</strong>. In Chapter 14 (see Appendix B for tutorial), we introduced you to the benefits of version control - a great way to incrementally save your analysis pipeline as you build it, helping you to roll-back to previous version if you accidentally introduce errors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preserve the computational environment</strong>. Even if your analysis pipeline is entirely reproducible on your own computer, you still need to consider whether it will run on somebody else‚Äôs computer, or even your own computer after you have updated your software. You can address this by documenting and preserving the computational environment in which the analysis pipeline runs successfully. Various tools are available to help with this, such as Code Ocean, renv (for R), and pip (for Python).</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.3.3</span> The reproducibiltiy-collaboration trade-off</h3>
<p>We would love to just leave it here and watch you walk off into the sunset with a spring in your step and a reproducible report under your arm, end of story. Unfortunately, we have to admit that writing reproducibly can create a few practical difficulties when it comes to collaboration. A major aspect of collaboration is exchanging comments and inline text edits with co-authors. You can do this with R Markdown files and Git, but these tools are not as user-friendly as, say, Word or Google Docs and many collaborators will be completely unfamiliar with them. Most journals also expect articles to be submitted as Word documents and outputing R Markdown files to Word can often introduce formatting issues, especially for moderately complex Tables. So until more user-friendly tools are introduced, some compromise between reproducibility and collaboration may be necessary. Here are three workflow styles we have used in our own work:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>maximal reproducibility</strong> approach. If your collaborators are familiar with R Markdown and you don‚Äôt mind exchanging comments and edits via Git, then you can maintain a fully reproducible workflow for your project, at least up until you release a preprint of your work. The journal submission and publication process may still introduce some issues (like incorporating changes made by the copy editor), but at least your preprint will be fully reproducible.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>two worlds</strong> approach. This workflow is a bit clunky, but it facilitates collaboration and maintains reproducibility. Firstly, generate your results section via R Markdown and export to a Word document. Copy and paste the entire results section into an empty Google Doc. Write the remainder of the manuscript in the Google Doc, including incorporating comments and changes from collaborators. When everyone‚Äôs happy you have a final version, copy and paste the abstract, introduction, methods, and discussion into the R Markdown document. Integrate any changes made to the results section requires a bit more effort. Save the Google Doc as a Word document and compare it to the original Word results section using Word‚Äôs ‚Äúcompare documents‚Äù feature. New changes will be highlighted. Manually integrate the changes into the R Markdown file. You can use ‚Äúcompare documents‚Äù again to ensure the version of the Word document generate by your R Markdown file aligns with the one you wrote with your collaborators (barring some formatting differences). The advantage of this approach is that you have a reproducible document and your collaborators have not had to deviate from their preferred workflow. Unfortunately, it requires more effort from you.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>reproducibility-lite</strong> approach. !!! Actually not sure what this is‚Ä¶ seems similar to above.</p></li>

<div id="writing-responsibly" class="section level2" number="15.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.4</span> Writing responsibly</h2>
<p>No study is perfect. Even the most rigorously designed research will have limitations, simply because doing science is hard! Errors are also likely to occur, because we‚Äôre only human, and we make mistakes.</p>
<p>It also your responsibility to communicate all relevant information about your study to enable other scientists to make an informed assessment. This includes methodological information, but also additional contextual information, like potential conflicts of interest or deviations from a preregistration. Finally, you will need to meet some scholarly obligations with regards to authorship and citations.</p>
<div id="responsible-disclosure-and-interpretation" class="section level3" number="15.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.4.1</span> Responsible disclosure and interpretation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Show your work</strong>. Back in school, we all learned that getting the right answer is not enough, you need to demonstrate how you arrived at that answer in order to get full marks. The same expectation applies to research reports. Don‚Äôt just tell the reader what you found, tell them how you found it. That means providing <em>all</em> methodological details<label for="tufte-sn-231" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">231</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-231" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">231</span> Its pretty easy to overlook key details, especially when you reach the end of a project. Looking back at your study preregistration can be a helpful reminder. Reporting guidelines are also a helpful resource to reminder you of the key information that should be reported for different research designs (see <span class="citation">Appelbaum et al. (<a href="#ref-appelbaum2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>)</span>, including data, materials, and analysis scripts,. You do have some flexibility in terms of how much detail you provide in the main body and how much you relegate to the supplementary information. Readers have different needs; some may just want to know the highlights, and some will want to replicate your study and therefore need all the details. As a rule-of-thumb, try to make sure there is nothing in the supplementary information that would surprise the reader. You certainty should not use the supplementary information to hide important details or use it as a disorganized dumping ground - the principles of clear writing still apply here!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acknowledge limitations</strong>. All studies inevitably have limitations; for example, if your sample consisted only of university students or only used two different stimuli, the study may have limited generalizability. Think carefully about the limitations of your study and state these limtations clearly in the discussion section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don‚Äôt overclaim</strong>. Unfortunately, scientists often feel (and often are) evaluated based on the results of their research rather than the quality of the research. Consequently, it can be tempting to make bigger and bolder claims about your research than are really justified by the evidence. Think carefully about the limitations of your research and calibrate your conclusions to the evidence your have obtained, rather than what you hope to be able to claim. Ensure that your conclusions are appropriately stated throughtout the manuscript, including the title and abstract<label for="tufte-sn-232" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">232</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-232" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">232</span> Overclaiming in titles is particularly common. Its usually best to avoid stating conclusions in the title at all because there are fewer words available to properly hedge and provide context. Instead, your title should focus on the research aim and method, for example, ‚ÄúDoes post-event exposure to misinformation disrupt recall accuracy of eyewitnesses? An experimental investigation‚Äù</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discuss, don‚Äôt debate</strong>. In the discussion section, your job is to help the reader interpret your research. Importantly, it is not a debate - don‚Äôt feel the need to argue dogmatically for a particular position or interpretation <label for="tufte-sn-233" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">233</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-233" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">233</span> The goal of a debate is to win, the goal of a discussion is to exchange ideas.</span>. You should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence you can obtained, and the reletive merits of different interpretations. For example, perhaps there is a potential confounding variable that you were unable to eliminate with your research design. The reader might be able to spot this themselves, but regardless, its your responsibility to highlight it for them. Perhaps on balance you think the confound is unlikely to explain the results - that‚Äôs fine, but you need to explain your reasoning to the reader.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disclose conflicts of interest and funding</strong>. Researchers are usually personally invested in the outcomes of their researcher and this can lead to bias (for example, overclaiming). However, sometimes the personal gains from researcher rise above a particular threshold and are considered ‚Äòconflicts of interest‚Äô that should be disclosed to readers. The most obvious conflicts of interest occur when you stand to benefit financially from the outcomes of your research (for example a pharmaceutical company evaluating their own drug). Where the threshold lies is not always completely clear. If in doubt, disclose it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Report transparently</strong>. In Chapter (LINK), you learned about the problem of selective reporting and how it can bias research results and conclusions. The accident report describes how NOT to do it. There are several ways to avoid this in your own work. Firstly, assuming you have reported everything, include a statement in the methods section that explicitly says so. A statement suggested by <span class="citation">Joseph P. Simmons et al. (<a href="#ref-simmons2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> is ‚ÄúWe report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study.‚Äù If you have preregistered your study, clearly link to the preregistration and state whether you deviated from your original plan. You can include a detailed preregistration disclosure table in the supplementary information and highlight any major deviations in the methods section. In the results section, clearly identify (e.g., with sub-headings) which analyses were preplanned and included in the preregistration (confirmatory) and which were not planned (exploratory).</p></li>

<li><strong>Describe the error</strong>. Readers need to know the exact nature of the error.</li>
<li><strong>Describe the implications of the error</strong>. Readers need to know how the error might affect their interpretation of the results.</li>
<li><strong>Describe how the error occurred</strong>. Its useful to know how the error happened so others can avoid the same error.</li>
<li><strong>Describe what you have done to address the error</strong>. Others may learn from how any changes you have made to your workflow that might reduce the chance of the error happening again.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledge the person who identified the error</strong>. Identifying errors often requires a lot of work; if the person is willing to be identified, this will give credit where credit is due.</li>

<div id="responsible-authorship-and-citation" class="section level3" number="15.4.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.4.3</span> Responsible authorship and citation</h3>
<p>Science is a community activity - its important to acknowledge the contributions of other scholars to your work. This includes citing previous work and acknowledging direct contributions to the current work.</p>
<p><strong>Cite sources</strong>. When you build upon prior work, you should cite it. This ensures the authors of prior work receive credit for their contribution and allows readers to verify the basis of your claims. Try to be explicit about why you are citing a source, for example, does it provide evidence to support your point? Is it relevant review? Or is it a description of a theory you are testing? You should certainly avoid copying the work of others and presenting as your own (plagiarism, see Chapter <a href="4-ethics.html#ethics">4</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Read before you cite</strong>. Make sure you read articles before you cite them to ensure you understand them. <span class="citation">Stang et al. (<a href="#ref-stang2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> reports a troubling case of citation misuse. One of the authors had previously published a commentary criticizing a methodological tool (the Newcastle‚ÄìOttawa scale) designed to assess the quality of non-randomized trials. They recommend the tool should not be used. The commentary was highly cited - in fact, it received more citations than the article that originally introduced the tool. <span class="citation">Stang et al. (<a href="#ref-stang2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> examined a random sample of 96 systematic reviews that cited the critical commentary and found that 94 of them suggested the commentary <em>supported</em> the use of the scale!.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid selective or uncritical citation</strong>. Only citing prior work that supports the point you are trying to make is misleading. You should provide a balanced account of prior work, including evidence that contradicts your point. Make sure to evaluate and integrate evidence, rather than simply listing studies. Remember - every study has limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge authors and contributors</strong>. Its important to acknowledge the individuals who worked on a research project so they can be properly credited and so the community knows who is responsible for the work. Currently in academic, the <em>authorship model</em> is dominant. Under this model, authorship and authorship order are important signals about researchers contributions to a project. It is generally expected that to qualify for authorship, an individual should have made a substantial contribution to the research, assists with writing the research report, and takes joint responsibility for the research along with the other co-authors. Individuals who worked on the prokect but do not reach this threshold are mentioned in a separate acknowledgements section, but not considered ‚Äòauthors‚Äô. Authorship order is often taken as an approximate indicate of an authors contribution. In psychology (and neighbouring disciplines), the first author and last author are typically the project leaders. The first author is often a junior colleague who practically implements the project and the last author is often a senior colleague who supervises the project. It has been argued that the authorship model should be replaced with a more inclusive <em>contributorship</em> model in which all individuals who worked on the project are acknowlegded as ‚Äòcontributors‚Äô and there is no arbitrary authorship threshold. The actual contributions of each individual are explictly described, rather than relying on the conventions of authorship order. This might help to facilitate collaboration and ensure student assistants are properly credited for their contributions. You will porbably find that most journals still expect you to use the authorship model; however, its usually possible to include a contributorship statement in your article that states what everybody did<label for="tufte-sn-237" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">237</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-237" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">237</span> Check out the CREDIT taxonomy and the tool Tenzing <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-holcombe2020" role="doc-biblioref">Holcombe et al., 2020</a>)</span></span>. Because authorship is such an important signal in academia, its important to agree on an authorship plan with your collaborators (particularly who will be the first and last authors)</p>

He subsequently discovered that the journal would not accept this for single-authored articles. These were the old days and Hetherington had painstakingly tapped out the article on his type writer, an exercise he was not keen to repeat.
