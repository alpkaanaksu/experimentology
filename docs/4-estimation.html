<!-- * Idea of a sampling distribution (or could go in "Inference") -->
<p>In the first section of this book, our goal was to set up some of the theoretical ideas that motivate our approach to experimental design and planning. We introduced our key thesis, namely that experiments are about measuring causal effects. We also began to discuss some of our key themes, including precision of measurement, reduction of bias, and generalization across populations. In this next section of the book‚Äìtreating statistical topics‚Äìwe will integrate these ideas with an analytic toolkit for <strong>estimating</strong> effects, <strong>quantifying the size and precision</strong> of these estimates (this chapter), making <strong>inferences</strong> about the evidence for such effects (Chapter <a href="5-inference.html#inference">5</a>), and making <strong>models</strong> for estimation and inference in more complex settings (Chapter <a href="6-models.html#models">6</a>). Although this book is not a statistics text, we hope that these chapters provide some practical foundations for beginning the statistical analysis of your experimental data.</p>
<div class="case-study">
<p>üî¨ Case study: The Lady Tasting Tea</p>
<p>The birth of modern statistical inference came from a single, epochal act of mansplaining.<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> An important piece of context for the work of Ronald Fisher, Karl Pearson, and other early pioneers of statistical inference is that they were all strong proponents of eugenics. Fisher was the founding Chairman of the Cambridge Eugenics Society. Pearson was perhaps even worse, an avowed Social Darwinist who believed fervently in Eugenic legislation. These views are repugnant.</span> Sir Ronald Fisher was apparently at a party when a lady declared that she could tell the difference between cups when the tea was added to the milk vs.¬†the milk to the tea. Rather than taking her at her word, Fisher devised an experimental and data analysis procedure to test her claim.<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> If you‚Äôre interested in this history, we recommend <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-salsburg2001" role="doc-biblioref">Salsburg</a> (<a href="#ref-salsburg2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>‚Äôs delightful book, ‚ÄúThe Lady Tasting Tea,‚Äù about the origins of modern statistics.</span></p>
<p>The basic schema of the experiment was that the lady would have to judge a set of new cups of tea and sort them into milk-first vs.¬†tea-first sets. Her data would then be analyzed to determine whether her level of correct choice exceeded that expected by chance. While this process now sounds like a quotidian experiment that might be done on a cooking reality show, in fact this is one of those touchstones that feels unremarkable because it literally established the way science was done for the next century.</p>
<p>One important element of the experiment that was unusual was its treatment of design confounds such as pouring order or cup material. Prior experimental practice would have been to try to equate all of the cups as closely as possible, decreasing the influence of confounders. Fisher recognized that this strategy was insufficient and that random assignment was critical for making strong causal inferences about the treatment (milk then tea vs.¬†tea then milk). We discussed the causal power of random assignment in Chapter <a href="1-intro.html#intro">1</a> ‚Äì this experiment is a key touchstone in the popularization of randomized experiments!<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> Randomized experiments were not invented by Fisher. Perhaps the earliest example of a (somewhat) randomized experiment was a trial of scurvey treatments in the 1700s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dunn1997" role="doc-biblioref">Dunn, 1997</a>)</span>. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-peirce1884" role="doc-biblioref">Peirce &amp; Jastrow</a> (<a href="#ref-peirce1884" role="doc-biblioref">1884</a>)</span> also report a strikingly modern use of randomized stimulus presentation (via shuffling cards). Nevertheless, Fisher‚Äôs statistical work popularized randomized experiments throughout the sciences, in part by integrating them with a set of analytic methods.</span></p>

<div id="estimating-an-effect" class="section level2" number="4.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Estimating an effect</h2>
<p>If experiments are about estimating effects, how do we actually use our experimental data to make these estimates? With apologies to Fisher, for our example we‚Äôll design a slightly more modern version of his experiment using a Likert scale and a between-participants design. Our causal theory is that the tea quality is affected by milk ordering, so we‚Äôll test that by rating tea quality both milk-first and tea-first. We‚Äôll do this as a field trial in an English tea cafe: when people order tea with milk, we‚Äôll randomly present it milk-first or tea-first and then elicit a rating on a Likert scale from 1 (terrible) to 10 (delicious). We‚Äôll do this for 48 customers and then take a look at the data.<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> Right now we‚Äôre going to assume that our ratings are just simple numerical values and not worry about the fact that they come from a rating scale. This is what people often do, though it can cause problems in certain cases. If you‚Äôre curious about Likert scales, we‚Äôll talk a bit more about them in Chapter <a href="7-measurement.html#measurement">7</a>.</span></p>
<p>Eventually, we‚Äôll want to estimate the effect of milk-first preparation on quality ratings. But for now, our goal will be to estimate the quality of the tea when it is milk-first [the better way, according to some data; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-kennedy2003" role="doc-biblioref">Kennedy</a> (<a href="#ref-kennedy2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>]. More formally, we want to use our <strong>sample</strong> of 24 milk-first tea judgments to estimate a <strong>population parameter</strong> that we can‚Äôt directly observe, namely the true perceived quality of all possible milk-first cups.
<!-- Here we're looking at this simple estimation problem rather than the more familiar problem where we have a sample of different people from a population and we want to try and estimate the population parameter.[^6] In Chapter \@ref(models) we'll talk more about modeling variability across experimental participants from a population. --></p>
<!-- [^6]: I don't think I understand the distinction. In the tea case, are we not estimating a population parameter (the causal effect of milk ordering) based on a sample? -->
<p>We‚Äôll try to go easy on notation but some amount will make things clearer. We will use <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (‚Äútheta‚Äù) to denote the parameter we want to estimate (the ‚Äúestimand‚Äù) and <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> its sample estimate.<label for="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">5</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">5</span> Statisticians use ‚Äúhats‚Äù like this to denote sample estimates. One way to remember this is that the ‚Äúperson in the hat‚Äù is wearing a hat to dress up as the actual quantity. Feel free to ignore this but it helps us.</span></p>

<!-- \[Note from NC: we do not currently use the terms "sample estimate", "point estimate" and "estimands" consistently in this chapter.

<div id="maximum-likelihood-estimation" class="section level3" number="4.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Maximum likelihood estimation</h3>
<p>OK, you are probably saying, if we we want our estimate of milk-first quality, shouldn‚Äôt we just take the average rating across the 24 cups of milk-first tea? The answer is yes, but let‚Äôs unpack that choice for just a moment.</p>
<p>Taking the sample mean as our estimate <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> is an example of an estimation approach called <strong>maximum likelihood estimation</strong>. In general terms, maximum likelihood estimation is a two-step process. First, we assume a <strong>model</strong> for how the data were generated. This model is specified in terms of certain population parameters. In our example, the ‚Äúmodel‚Äù is as simple as they come: we just assume there is some level of tea quality such that people‚Äôs ratings are sampled from a normal distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{milk first}\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">6</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">6</span> In other problems, like multivariable regression, the model is more complicated, for example involving more than one regression coefficient ‚Äì that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll get to in Chapter <a href="6-models.html#models">6</a>.</span></p>
<p>Second, we try to find the values of the population parameters that make our observed data as likely as possible. For example, if our sample mean is <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta_{milk first}} = 4.5\)</span>, what underlying value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{milk first}\)</span> would make these data most likely to occur? Well, suppose the underlying parameter were <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{milk first}=2.5\)</span>. Then it would be pretty unlikely that our sample mean would be so much bigger. So <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{milk first}=2.5\)</span> is a poor guess for the population parameter based on these data. Conversely, if the parameter were <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{milk first}=6.5\)</span>, it would be a bit unlikely that our sample mean would be so much <em>smaller</em>. The value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{milk first}\)</span> that makes these data most likely is just 4.5 itself: the sample mean! That is why the sample mean in this case is the maximum likelihood estimate.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimating-variation-in-ratings" class="section level3" number="4.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Estimating variation in ratings</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs visualize our 24 milk-first tea ratings. Since ratings on our scale are discrete, Figure <a href="4-estimation.html#fig:estimation-milk-first">4.1</a> shows them as a histogram. Our estimate of the mean, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta_{milk first}}\)</span>, is shown as a blue dashed line.</p>
<p>Our observations are clustered around the mean, but they also show some variation. Some are higher and some are lower. Variation of this type is a critical feature of every data set. This variation can be described via a <strong>probability distribution</strong>, a mathematical entity that describes the properties of possible datasets. The only probability distribution we‚Äôll discuss here is the ubiquitous <strong>normal distribution</strong> (also sometimes called a ‚ÄúGaussian distribution‚Äù). A normal distribution has two <strong>parameters</strong>, a mean and a <strong>standard deviation</strong>. These two parameters define the shape of the curve. The mean describes where its center goes, and the standard deviation describes how wide it is.</p>
<p>The blue curve shown in Figure <a href="4-estimation.html#fig:estimation-milk-first">4.1</a> is the normal distribution that is closest to the data in our milk-first condition. Its mean is of course <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta_{milk first}}\)</span>, the parameter we just estimated. But to plot this curve, we also had to estimate the standard deviation. It turns out that the standard deviation is just exactly what its name says: the average deviation between the mean and any given observation. We won‚Äôt discuss how to estimate the standard deviation for your sample here, since this would take us into statistical theory. What‚Äôs important for now is just that the standard deviation gives us a way to describe the width of the normal distribution.</p>

<div id="bayesian-estimation" class="section level3" number="4.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Bayesian estimation</h3>
<p>The above examples describes a common approach to estimating values, where the researcher completely puts aside their prior expectations about what these values might be. Often this approach makes sense, especially when we have no prior expectations about the values we are estimating. But sometimes we <em>do</em> have relevant beliefs about the value. For example, before we perform our tea experiment, we don‚Äôt know exactly what <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> will be, but it seems a bit unlikely that tea would be rated as either horrible or perfect. We have what you might call <em>weak prior expectations</em> about the kinds of ratings we‚Äôll receive.</p>
<p>These kind of expectations are most useful when we have a very small amount of data. For example, if our very first participant in the experiment rated their tea as terrible, we wouldn‚Äôt want to jump to the conclusion that the tea was actually bad. Instead, we might speculate that the participant was having a bad day. On the other hand, if all of our participants gave bad ratings to their tea, we might want to tell the cafe that they are serving sub-standard tea. With a little data, our prior expectations might moderate our conclusions; as we get more data, we should probably put more weight on the data.</p>
<p>How do we quantify this tradeoff between prior expectations and current observations? We can do this via <strong>Bayesian estimation</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{milkfirst}\)</span>. Bayesian estimation provides a principled framework for integrating prior beliefs and data. These estimation techniques can be very helpful in cases where data are sparse or prior beliefs are strong.</p>
<p>In Bayesian estimation, we observe some data <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, consisting of the set of correct and incorrect responses in the experiment. Now we can use <strong>Bayes‚Äô rule</strong>, a tool from basic probability theory, to estimate this number. Bayes‚Äô rule says:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\color{purple}{p(\theta | d)} = \frac{\color{red}{p(d | \theta )} \color{blue}{p(\theta )}}{\color{black}{p(d)}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Each part of this equation has a name, and it‚Äôs worth becoming familiar with them. The thing we want to compute (<span class="math inline">\(p(\theta |d)\)</span>) is called the <strong>posterior probability</strong> ‚Äì it tell us what we should believe about the participant‚Äôs ability given the data we observed. We then break that down into two terms in the numerator.<label for="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">7</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">7</span> We‚Äôre making the posterior <span style="color: purple;">purple</span> to indicate the combination of likelihood (<span style="color: red;">red</span>) and prior (<span style="color: blue;">blue</span>).</span></p>
<p>The first part of the numerator is <span class="math inline">\(p(d|h)\)</span>, the probability of the data we observed given our hypothesis about the participant‚Äôs ability. This part is called the <strong>likelihood</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">8</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">8</span> Speaking informally, ‚Äúlikelihood‚Äù is just a synonym for probability, but this is a technical meaning for the term, which can get a bit confusing.</span> This term tells us about the relationship between our hypothesis and the data we observed ‚Äì so if we think the tea is of high quality (say <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 6.5\)</span>) then the probability of a bunch of low accuracy observations will be fairly low.</p>
<p>The second term in the numerator, <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta )\)</span>, is called the <strong>prior</strong>. This term encodes our beliefs about the likely distribution of tea quality. Intuitively, if we think that the tea is likely of high quality, we should require more evidence to convince us that it‚Äôs bad. In contrast, if we think it‚Äôs probably bad, a few examples of low ratings might serve to convince us.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="4-estimation.html#fig:inference-bayes-demo">4.2</a> gives an example of the combination of prior and data.[^13] In this example, we look at what difference the prior makes after observing 3 ratings. When we use a flat prior, we get the same estimate of 4.9.[^14] In contrast, if we go in assuming that the tea is likely to be bad, we are biased downward in our eventual estimate of 4.7; if we go in assuming good discrimination, we end up biased upwards to 5.2.</p>

</div>
<p>In general, Bayesian estimates and maximum likelihood estimates will exactly coincide either under a flat prior or as you get infinite data (<span class="math inline">\(n \to \infty\)</span>). Take a look at Figure <a href="4-estimation.html#fig:inference-bayes-demo2">4.3</a> to see what happens when we include all the data. There is some bias in the estimates based on the prior, but it‚Äôs much less extreme and the posterior distribution is sharply peaked pretty close to the mean of the data.</p>
<p>Bayesian estimation is most important when you have strong beliefs and not a lot of data! That can be a case where you have just a few participants in your experiment, but it‚Äôs also good ‚Äì and perhaps more common ‚Äì to use Bayesian methods when you have a lot of data, but maybe not that much data about particular units that you care about. For example, you might have a large dataset about the effects of an educational intervention but not that much data about how it affects a particular subgroup.</p>

<div id="estimating-and-comparing-effects" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Estimating and comparing effects</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve now covered estimating a single parameter (the mean in just the milk-first group) using both frequentist and Bayesian methods. But recall that what we really wanted to do was to estimate the causal effect we were interested in, namely the milk-first vs.¬†tea-first effect.<label for="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">9</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">9</span> This doesn‚Äôt have to be a causal effect, it can just be any between-group difference.

<div id="estimating-the-treatment-effect" class="section level3" number="4.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Estimating the treatment effect</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs refer to the causal effect we care about as our <strong>treatment effect</strong>, called. In practice, estimating <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is going to be a pretty straightforward extension to what we did before.</p>
<!-- [^15]: I'd suggest framing this section as "estimating a between-group difference" rather than "estimating a treatment effect" since, as noted above, nothing in this chapter seems specific to causal inference.MCF: I caveated, but the whole framing of the book is kind of about causal inference in experiments, so I think it's ok.-->
<p>In the maximum likelihood framework, we could posit that ratings in each group (milk-first and tea-first) follow a normal distribution, but that these normal distributions might have different means and standard deviations. Extending the notation introduced above, let‚Äôs term the parameters for the tea-first group <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{teafirst}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{teafirst}\)</span>. To estimate the treatment effect, we are positing a <strong>model</strong> in which the milk-first ratings are normal with mean <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{milkfirst} = \theta_{teafirst} + \Delta\)</span> with standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{milkfirst}\)</span>. As in the one-sample case (i.e., estimating the mean of just the milk-first group), maximum likelihood estimation would then proceed by finding the value of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> that makes the data most likely under the assumed model. As you‚Äôd probably expect, this estimate <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta}\)</span> turns out to be simply the difference in sample means, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{milkfirst} - \theta_{teafirst}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the Bayesian framework, we would again specify a prior, <span class="math inline">\(p(\Delta )\)</span>, that encodes our prior beliefs about the size and direction of the treatment effect. If we have no prior beliefs at all, then we could again specify a flat prior, <span class="math inline">\(p(\Delta ) \propto 1\)</span>. If we believe the treatment effect is likely to favor milk-first pouring (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta&gt;0\)</span>), we could specify a normal prior centered at some positive value (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=0.5\)</span>); the standard deviation of this prior would encode how certain we are about our prior beliefs. If we have no prior beliefs about the direction of the treatment effect, but we think it is unlikely to be very large, we could specify a normal prior centered at 0, which has the effect of ‚Äúshrinking‚Äù the estimates closer to 0.<label for="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">10</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">10</span> The measures of variability that we discuss here account for statistical uncertainty reflecting the fact that we have only a finite sample size. If the sample size were infinite, there would be no uncertainty of this kind. Of course, this is only one kind of uncertainty, and a more holistic view of the overall credibility of an estimate must also account for study design and bias, for example.</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Measures of effect size</h3>
<p>Once we have measured something, we need to make a decision about how to describe this relationship to the world. Sometimes we are working with fairly intuitive relationships that are easy to describe. A researcher might say, for example, that people who received milk-first tea drank the tea, on average, 5 minutes quicker than people who received tea-first tea (i.e., that <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta}_{time} = 5\)</span>). We all have a shared understanding of what 5 minutes mean, so people will likely not have much trouble understanding this estimated effect. But what about our participants‚Äô ratings of tea quality, which were provided on a 10-point scale (1 being ‚Äúterrible‚Äù; 10 being ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù)? What does it mean to that participants who drank milk-first tea rated it 1 point higher on a 10-point scale than participants who drank tea-first tea (i.e., that <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta}_{rating} = 1\)</span>)? And how is this comparable to, for instance, a 1-point change on a scale that has similar anchors but uses a 100-point rating system (1 being ‚Äúterrible‚Äù; 100 being ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù)?</p>
<p>To provide a common language for describing these relationships, some researchers use <em>standardized effect sizes.</em> A common standardized effect size is Cohen‚Äôs <em>d</em>, which provides a standardized estimate of the difference between two means. There are many different ways to calculate Cohen‚Äôs <em>d</em> (Lakens, 2013), but all approaches are usually some variant of the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d = \frac{M_1- M_2}{SD}\]</span></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with our tea-drinking study that used a 10-point excitement scale. <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> refers to the mean quality ratings of people who drank milk-first tea (a 4.5 out of 10), <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> refers to the mean mean quality ratings of people who drank tea-first tea (a 3.5 out of 10), and <span class="math inline">\(SD\)</span> refers to the standard deviation of all the people in the study (let‚Äôs assume this is 1.25). This leaves us with:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{d_{children.study}} = \frac{M_1- M_2}{SD} = \frac{5- 4}{1} = \frac{1}{1.25} = 0.80\]</span></p>
<p>We previously said that people who drank milk-first tea had quality ratings that were, on average, 1 point higher on a 10-point scale (<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta}_{rating} = 1\)</span>). This Cohen‚Äôs <em>d</em> translates this in terms of standard deviations, saying that people who drank milk-first tea had quality ratings that were, on average, 0.80 standard deviation higher than the people who drank tea-first tea. You may find yourself wondering: ‚Äúbut why on Earth would I ever describe things in terms of standard deviations!?‚Äù Hold our tea, because we‚Äôll next show you how doing so allows us to compare the size of the effect to studies using different measures!</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say that we ran a conceptual replication of the study with two changes: (1) we studied patrons in a U.S. cafe instead of a English tea cafe, and (2) we used a 100-point quality rating scale instead of a 10-point scale. And imagine that, just as we found that patron in our English tea cafe rated the milk-first tea 1-point higher on a 10-point quality scale, that U.S. cafe patrons rated the milk-free tea 1-point higher on a <em>100-point</em> quality scale. Intuitively, it is obvious that these effects are different. And, statistically, this becomes clear when we describe the effect in terms of standardized mean differences.</p>
<p>For the cross-cultural replication in the U.S. cafe, let‚Äôs imagine that (a) patrons who drank milk-first tea rated the quality of the tea, on average, as a 50 (<span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>) out of 100, and (b) patrons who drank tea-first tea rated it, on average, a 49 (<span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>). To keep things simple, let‚Äôs also assume that variability in the U.S cafe patrons ratings are equal to those in the English tea cafe. If this is the case, a standard deviation of 1.25 on a 10-point scale is equivalent to a standard deviation of 12.50 on the 100-point scale (<span class="math inline">\(SD = 12.50\)</span>). Using the same formula as above, we would find:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{d_{adult.study}} = \frac{M_1- M_2}{SD} = \frac{50- 49}{12.50} = \frac{1}{12.50} =  0.08\]</span></p>
<p>A Cohen‚Äôs <em>d</em> of .08 means that U.S cafe patrons rated their tea .08 standard deviations higher when it contained milk-first as opposed to tea-first. This is much smaller than the .80 standard deviation difference observed among English cafe patrons. Indeed, social scientists often consider <em>d</em> = 0.80 to be a large effect, and a <em>d</em> = 0.08 to be negligible. These effect size interpretation norms are somewhat arbitrary and there are many exceptions, but you get the point: even though the U.S. and English patrons had the same raw score change in quality ratings (<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta} = 1\)</span>), standardizing the differences allowed us to communicate that the difference was much larger among the English patrons.</p>
<p>Cohen‚Äôs <em>d</em> is one of many standardized effect sizes that researchers can use. Just as Cohen‚Äôs <em>d</em> standardizes differences in group means, there are also ways of standardizing relationships between categorical variables (e.g., Odds Ratio), how well a predictor variable explains an outcome variable (e.g., Pearson‚Äôs <em>r</em>, R<sup>2</sup>, and <span class="math inline">\(\eta^2\)</span>), and more! For a review, see Fritz, Morris, and Richler (2012).</p>

<div id="pros-and-cons-of-standardizing-effect-sizes" class="section level3" number="4.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Pros and cons of standardizing effect sizes</h3>
<p>By now, you‚Äôre probably realizing that there are some pros and cons of standardizing effect sizes. Sure, it helps communicate that a 1-point change on a 10-point scale is not the same as a 1-point change on a 100-point scale. But, is it any better to say that the first change represents a 0.80 standard deviation difference and the second a 0.08 standard deviation difference? It‚Äôs a good question‚Äìone that researchers have argued about for a long time!</p>
<p>Proponents of effect size standardization argue that doing so allows us to more easily compare results across studies. Across studies, researchers use different measures; different study designs; and different populations. Standardization allows us to use a common language to describe estimated relationships in these varied contexts. This is helpful when we want to aggregate and compare effects across studies (via meta-analysis, see Chapter <a href="17-meta.html#meta">17</a>). And it is also helpful when planning new studies. When trying to figure out how many participants to run in a study, almost all programs use standardized effect sizes to determine, for example, how much data would be needed to reliably detect a specific standardized effect size.</p>
<!-- NC NOTE: ITS NICE TO BRING UP POWER ANALYSIS, BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH BACKGROUND THE READER WILL HAVE AT THIS POINT.-->
<!-- [STILL VERBATIM FROM MRM]  NC FOLLOW-UP: WHICH PART IS VERBATIM? -->
<p>Standardizing effect sizes, though, has limitations. For example, if two interventions produce the same absolute change in the same outcome measure, but are studied in different populations in which the variability on the outcome differs substantially, the interventions would produce different standardized mean differences.</p>
<!-- NC: I THINK THE ABOVE TEXT IS A BIT ABSTRACT. ADDING AN EXAMPLE BELOW. IF WE REALLY WANT TO DRIVE THE POINT HOME, A FIGURE COULD BE HELPFUL -->
<p>For example, let‚Äôs assume that drinking tea leads to the same absolute changes in feelings of quality in adults and children. Furthermore, imagine that adults generally have more consistent excitement levels than children (e.g., that a randomly selected adults would generally be consistently calm, but that a randomly selected sample of children would consist of some kids nodding off and other kids bouncing off the walls with excitement). Quantitatively, this would often lead us to observe a smaller standard deviation in excitement levels in adults (e.g., let‚Äôs assume <span class="math inline">\(SD_{adults} = 1\)</span> ) vs.¬†children (e.g., let‚Äôs assume <span class="math inline">\(SD_{children} = 2\)</span>). In this scenario, even if tea led to the same 1-point absolute change in feelings of excitement among adults and children, the standardized effect size would look quite different.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{d_{adult.study}} = \frac{M_1- M_2}{SD} = \frac{5- 4}{1} = \frac{1}{1} =  1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{d_{children.study}} = \frac{M_1- M_2}{SD} = \frac{5- 4}{2} = \frac{1}{2} =  0.50\]</span></p>
<p>This example highlights some of the challenges with standardization. If we focused on the fact that both adults and children experienced a 1-point change in excitement levels (<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta} = 1\)</span>), we would conclude that espresso leads to equal changes in excitement among adults and children. If we focused on the standardized effect sizes, however, we would conclude that the effect of tea is twice as big for adults vs.¬†children.</p>
<p>So which is better: describing raw scores or standardized scores? In general our response is ‚ÄúWhy not both?‚Äù But if you wanted to pick one or the other, we recommend focusing on raw scores when working with measures that are (a) intuitive to understand (e.g., temperature), and/or used fairly consistently across studies (e.g., measuring blood pressure in terms of mmHg). When, however, working with measures that are (a) relatively unintuitive to understand (e.g.¬†changes on an arbitrary 7-point Likert-type scale) or (b) used inconsistently across studies (e.g., measuring excitement with a 10-point scale in one study and a 100-point scale in a different study), we recommend standardized effect sizes.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Summary: Estimation</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we introduced the idea of estimating both individual measurements and treatment effects from observed data. These ideas are simple but they lay the foundations for drawing inferences, where we move from estimates within a particular sample to inferences about the population. Further, we set up the distinction between Bayesian and frequentist approaches, which we will expand in the next chapter since these traditions provide different inferential tools.</p>
